chapter i
there was no possibility of taking a walk that day  we had beenwandering  indeed  in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning but since dinner (mrs  reed  when there was no company  dined early)the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre  and arain so penetrating  that further outdoor exercise was now out ofthe question
i was glad of it  i never liked long walks  especially on chillyafternoons  dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight with nipped fingers and toes  and a heart saddened by the chidingsof bessie  the nurse  and humbled by the consciousness of myphysical inferiority to eliza  john  and georgiana reed
the said eliza  john  and georgiana were now clustered roundtheir mama in the drawing room  she lay reclined on a sofa by thefireside  and with her darlings about her (for the time neitherquarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy  me  she haddispensed from joining the group  saying   she regretted to be underthe necessity of keeping me at a distance  but that until she heardfrom bessie  and could discover by her own observation  that i wasendeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable andchildlike disposition  a more attractive and sprightly manner something lighter  franker  more natural  as it were  she reallymust exclude me from privileges intended only for contented  happy little children
what does bessie say i have done   i asked
jane  i don t like cavillers or questioners  besides  there issomething truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in thatmanner  be seated somewhere  and until you can speak pleasantly remain silent
a small breakfast room adjoined the drawing room  i slipped inthere  it contained a bookcase  i soon possessed myself of a volume taking care that it should be one stored with pictures  i mounted intothe window seat  gathering up my feet  i sat cross legged  like aturk  and  having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close  i wasshrined in double retirement
folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand  tothe left were the clear panes of glass  protecting  but not separatingme from the drear november day  at intervals  while turning over theleaves of my book  i studied the aspect of that winter afternoon afar  it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud  near a scene of wetlawn and storm beat shrub  with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildlybefore a long and lamentable blast
i returned to my book  bewick s history of british birds  theletterpress thereof i cared little for  generally speaking  and yetthere were certain introductory pages that  child as i was  i couldnot pass quite as a blank  they were those which treat of the hauntsof sea fowl  of  the solitary rocks and promontories  by them onlyinhabited  of the coast of norway  studded with isles from itssouthern extremity  the lindeness  or naze  to the north cape
where the northern ocean  in vast whirls
boils round the naked  melancholy isles
of farthest thule  and the atlantic surge
pours in among the stormy hebrides
nor could i pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores oflapland  siberia  spitzbergen  nova zembla  iceland  greenland  with the vast sweep of the arctic zone  and those forlorn regions ofdreary space   that reservoir of frost and snow  where firm fieldsof ice  the accumulation of centuries of winters  glazed in alpineheights above heights  surround the pole and concentre themultiplied rigours of extreme cold   of these death white realms iformed an idea of my own  shadowy  like all the half comprehendednotions that float dim through children s brains  but strangelyimpressive  the words in these introductory pages connected themselveswith the succeeding vignettes  and gave significance to the rockstanding up alone in a sea of billow and spray  to the broken boatstranded on a desolate coast  to the cold and ghastly moon glancingthrough bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking
i cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard with its inscribed headstone  its gate  its two trees  its lowhorizon  girdled by a broken wall  and its newly risen crescent attesting the hour of eventide
the two ships becalmed on a torpid sea  i believed to be marinephantoms
the fiend pinning down the thief s pack behind him  i passed overquickly  it was an object of terror
so was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock  surveying adistant crowd surrounding a gallows
each picture told a story  mysterious often to my undevelopedunderstanding and imperfect feelings  yet ever profoundly interesting as interesting as the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winterevenings  when she chanced to be in good humour  and when  havingbrought her ironing table to the nursery hearth  she allowed us to sitabout it  and while she got up mrs  reed s lace frills  and crimpedher nightcap borders  fed our eager attention with passages of loveand adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads  or (asat a later period i discovered) from the pages of pamela  and henry earl of moreland
with bewick on my knee  i was then happy  happy at least in my way i feared nothing but interruption  and that came too soon  thebreakfast room door opened
boh  madam mope   cried the voice of john reed  then he paused  hefound the room apparently empty
where the dickens is she   he continued   lizzy  georgy (calling to his sisters) joan is not here  tell mama she is run outinto the rain  bad animal
it is well i drew the curtain   thought i  and i wishedfervently he might not discover my hiding place  nor would john reedhave found it out himself  he was not quick either of vision orconception  but eliza just put her head in at the door  and said atonce
she is in the window seat  to be sure  jack
and i came out immediately  for i trembled at the idea of beingdragged forth by the said jack
what do you want   i asked  with awkward diffidence
say  "what do you want  master reed "  was the answer   i want youto come here   and seating himself in an armchair  he intimated by agesture that i was to approach and stand before him
john reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old  four years olderthan i  for i was but ten  large and stout for his age  with a dingyand unwholesome skin  thick lineaments in a spacious visage  heavylimbs and large extremities  he gorged himself habitually at table which made him bilious  and gave him a dim and bleared eye andflabby cheeks  he ought now to have been at school  but his mama hadtaken him home for a month or two   on account of his delicatehealth   mr  miles  the master  affirmed that he would do very well ifhe had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home  but the mother sheart turned from an opinion so harsh  and inclined rather to the morerefined idea that john s sallowness was owing to over application and perhaps  to pining after home
john had not much affection for his mother and sisters  and anantipathy to me  he bullied and punished me  not two or three times inthe week  nor once or twice in the day  but continually  every nerve ihad feared him  and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when hecame near  there were moments when i was bewildered by the terror heinspired  because i had no appeal whatever against either hismenaces or his inflictions  the servants did not like to offendtheir young master by taking my part against him  and mrs  reed wasblind and deaf on the subject  she never saw him strike or heard himabuse me  though he did both now and then in her very presence  morefrequently  however  behind her back
habitually obedient to john  i came up to his chair  he spentsome three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as hecould without damaging the roots  i knew he would soon strike  andwhile dreading the blow  i mused on the disgusting and ugly appearanceof him who would presently deal it  i wonder if he read that notion inmy face  for  all at once  without speaking  he struck suddenly andstrongly  i tottered  and on regaining my equilibrium retired back astep or two from his chair
that is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since   saidhe   and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains  and for thelook you had in your eyes two minutes since  you rat
accustomed to john reed s abuse  i never had an idea of replying toit  my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly followthe insult
what were you doing behind the curtain   he asked
i was reading
show the book
i returned to the window and fetched it thence
you have no business to take our books  you are a dependant mama says  you have no money  your father left you none  you oughtto beg  and not to live here with gentlemen s children like us  andeat the same meals we do  and wear clothes at our mama s expense  now i ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves  for they are mine  all thehouse belongs to me  or will do in a few years  go and stand by thedoor  out of the way of the mirror and the windows
i did so  not at first aware what was his intention  but when i sawhim lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it  iinstinctively started aside with a cry of alarm  not soon enough however  the volume was flung  it hit me  and i fell  striking my headagainst the door and cutting it  the cut bled  the pain was sharp my terror had passed its climax  other feelings succeeded
wicked and cruel boy   i said   you are like a murderer  you arelike a slave driver  you are like the roman emperors
i had read goldsmith s history of rome  and had formed my opinionof nero  caligula  etc  also i had drawn parallels in silence  which inever thought thus to have declared aloud
what  what   he cried   did she say that to me  did you hearher  eliza and georgiana  won t i tell mama  but first
he ran headlong at me  i felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder  hehad closed with a desperate thing  i really saw in him a tyrant  amurderer  i felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down myneck  and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering  these sensationsfor the time predominated over fear  and i received him in franticsort  i don t very well know what i did with my hands  but he calledme  rat  rat   and bellowed out aloud  aid was near him  eliza andgeorgiana had run for mrs  reed  who was gone upstairs  she now cameupon the scene  followed by bessie and her maid abbot  we were parted i heard the words
dear  dear  what a fury to fly at master john
did ever anybody see such a picture of passion
then mrs  reed subjoined
take her away to the red room  and lock her in there   fourhands were immediately laid upon me  and i was borne upstairs
chapter ii
i resisted all the way  a new thing for me  and a circumstancewhich greatly strengthened the bad opinion bessie and miss abbotwere disposed to entertain of me  the fact is  i was a trifle besidemyself  or rather out of myself  as the french would say  i wasconscious that a moment s mutiny had already rendered me liable tostrange penalties  and  like any other rebel slave  i felt resolved in my desperation  to go all lengths
hold her arms  miss abbot  she s like a mad cat
for shame  for shame   cried the lady s maid   what shockingconduct  miss eyre  to strike a young gentleman  your benefactress sson  your young master
master  how is he my master  am i a servant
no  you are less than a servant  for you do nothing for your keep there  sit down  and think over your wickedness
they had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by mrs reed  and had thrust me upon a stool  my impulse was to rise from itlike a spring  their two pair of hands arrested me instantly
if you don t sit still  you must be tied down   said bessie   missabbot  lend me your garters  she would break mine directly
miss abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessaryligature  this preparation for bonds  and the additional ignominy itinferred  took a little of the excitement out of me
don t take them off   i cried   i will not stir
in guarantee whereof  i attached myself to my seat by my hands
mind you don t   said bessie  and when she had ascertained thati was really subsiding  she loosened her hold of me  then she and missabbot stood with folded arms  looking darkly and doubtfully on myface  as incredulous of my sanity
she never did so before   at last said bessie  turning to theabigail
but it was always in her   was the reply   i ve told missisoften my opinion about the child  and missis agreed with me  she san underhand little thing  i never saw a girl of her age with somuch cover
bessie answered not  but ere long  addressing me  she said
you ought to be aware  miss  that you are under obligations tomrs  reed  she keeps you  if she were to turn you off  you wouldhave to go to the poorhouse
i had nothing to say to these words  they were not new to me  myvery first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind this reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing song in my ear very painful and crushing  but only half intelligible  miss abbotjoined in
and you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the missesreed and master reed  because missis kindly allows you to be broughtup with them  they will have a great deal of money  and you willhave none  it is your place to be humble  and to try to makeyourself agreeable to them
what we tell you is for your good   added bessie  in no harshvoice   you should try to be useful and pleasant  then  perhaps  youwould have a home here  but if you become passionate and rude missis will send you away  i am sure
besides   said miss abbot   god will punish her  he might strikeher dead in the midst of her tantrums  and then where would she go come  bessie  we will leave her  i wouldn t have her heart foranything  say your prayers  miss eyre  when you are by yourself  forif you don t repent  something bad might be permitted to come down thechimney and fetch you away
they went  shutting the door  and locking it behind them
the red room was a square chamber  very seldom slept in  i mightsay never  indeed  unless when a chance influx of visitors atgateshead hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all theaccommodation it contained  yet it was one of the largest andstateliest chambers in the mansion  a bed supported on massive pillarsof mahogany  hung with curtains of deep red damask  stood out like atabernacle in the centre  the two large windows  with their blindsalways drawn down  were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similardrapery  the carpet was red  the table at the foot of the bed wascovered with a crimson cloth  the walls were a soft fawn colour with ablush of pink in it  the wardrobe  the toilet table  the chairs wereof darkly polished old mahogany  out of these deep surroundingshades rose high  and glared white  the piled up mattresses andpillows of the bed  spread with a snowy marseilles counterpane scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy chair near thehead of the bed  also white  with a footstool before it  andlooking  as i thought  like a pale throne
this room was chill  because it seldom had a fire  it was silent because remote from the nursery and kitchen  solemn  because it wasknown to be so seldom entered  the housemaid alone came here onsaturdays  to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week s quietdust  and mrs  reed herself  at far intervals  visited it to reviewthe contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe  where werestored divers parchments  her jewel casket  and a miniature of herdeceased husband  and in those last words lies the secret of thered room  the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur
mr  reed had been dead nine years  it was in this chamber hebreathed his last  here he lay in state  hence his coffin was borne bythe undertaker s men  and  since that day  a sense of drearyconsecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion
my seat  to which bessie and the bitter miss abbot had left meriveted  was a low ottoman near the marble chimney piece  the bed rosebefore me  to my right hand there was the high  dark wardrobe  withsubdued  broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels  to myleft were the muffled windows  a great looking glass between themrepeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room  i was not quitesure whether they had locked the door  and when i dared move  i got upand went to see  alas  yes  no jail was ever more secure  returning  ihad to cross before the looking glass  my fascinated glanceinvoluntarily explored the depth it revealed  all looked colder anddarker in that visionary hollow than in reality  and the strangelittle figure there gazing at me  with a white face and armsspecking the gloom  and glittering eyes of fear moving where allelse was still  had the effect of a real spirit  i thought it like oneof the tiny phantoms  half fairy  half imp  bessie s evening storiesrepresented as coming out of lone  ferny dells in moors  and appearingbefore the eyes of belated travellers  i returned to my stool
superstition was with me at that moment  but it was not yet herhour for complete victory  my blood was still warm  the mood of therevolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour  i had tostem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before i quailed to thedismal present
all john reed s violent tyrannies  all his sisters  proudindifference  all his mother s aversion  all the servants  partiality turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well why was i always suffering  always browbeaten  always accused  forever condemned  why could i never please  why was it useless to try towin any one s favour  eliza  who  was headstrong and selfish  wasrespected  georgiana  who had a spoiled temper  a very acrid spite a captious and insolent carriage  was universally indulged  herbeauty  her pink cheeks and golden curls  seemed to give delight toall who  looked at her  and to purchase indemnity for every fault john no one thwarted  much less punished  though he twisted thenecks of the pigeons  killed the little pea chicks  set the dogs atthe sheep  stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit  and broke thebuds off the choicest plants in the conservatory  he called his mother old girl   too  sometimes reviled her for her dark skin  similar tohis own  bluntly disregarded her wishes  not unfrequently tore andspoiled her silk attire  and he was still  her own darling   i daredcommit no fault  i strove to fulfil every duty  and i was termednaughty and tiresome  sullen and sneaking  from morning to noon  andfrom noon to night
my head still ached and bled with the blow and fall i had received no one had reproved john for wantonly striking me  and because i hadturned against him to avert farther irrational violence  i wasloaded with general opprobrium
unjust   unjust   said my reason  forced by the agonising stimulusinto precocious though transitory power  and resolve  equallywrought up  instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape frominsupportable oppression  as running away  or  if that could not beeffected  never eating or drinking more  and letting myself die
what a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon  howall my brain was in tumult  and all my heart in insurrection  yet inwhat darkness  what dense ignorance  was the mental battle fought  icould not answer the ceaseless inward question  why i thus suffered now  at the distance of  i will not say how many years  i see itclearly
i was a discord in gateshead hall  i was like nobody there  i hadnothing in harmony with mrs  reed or her children  or her chosenvassalage  if they did not love me  in fact  as little did i lovethem  they were not bound to regard with affection a thing thatcould not sympathise with one amongst them  a heterogeneous thing opposed to them in temperament  in capacity  in propensities  auseless thing  incapable of serving their interest  or adding to theirpleasure  a noxious thing  cherishing the germs of indignation attheir treatment  of contempt of their judgment  i know that had i beena sanguine  brilliant  careless  exacting  handsome  romping child though equally dependent and friendless  mrs  reed would haveendured my presence more complacently  her children would haveentertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow feeling  theservants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of thenursery
daylight began to forsake the red room  it was past four o clock and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight  i heard therain still beating continuously on the staircase window  and thewind howling in the grove behind the hall  i grew by degrees cold as astone  and then my courage sank  my habitual mood of humiliation self doubt  forlorn depression  fell damp on the embers of my decayingire  all said i was wicked  and perhaps i might be so  what thoughthad i been but just conceiving of starving myself to death  thatcertainly was a crime  and was i fit to die  or was the vault underthe chancel of gateshead church an inviting bourne  in such vault ihad been told did mr  reed lie buried  and led by this thought torecall his idea  i dwelt on it with gathering dread  i could notremember him  but i knew that he was my own uncle  my mother sbrother  that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house and that in his last moments he had required a promise of mrs  reedthat she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children  mrs reed probably considered she had kept this promise  and so she had i dare say  as well as her nature would permit her  but how couldshe really like an interloper not of her race  and unconnected withher  after her husband s death  by any tie  it must have been mostirksome to find herself bound by a hard wrung pledge to stand in thestead of a parent to a strange child she could not love  and to see anuncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group
a singular notion dawned upon me  i doubted not  never doubted that if mr  reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly  andnow  as i sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimlygleaming mirror  i began to recall what i had heard of dead men troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge theoppressed  and i thought mr  reed s spirit  harassed by the wrongsof his sister s child  might quit its abode  whether in the churchvault or in the unknown world of the departed  and rise before me inthis chamber  i wiped my tears and hushed my sobs  fearful lest anysign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me or elicit from the gloom some haloed face  bending over me withstrange pity  this idea  consolatory in theory  i felt would beterrible if realised  with all my might i endeavoured to stifle it i endeavoured to be firm  shaking my hair from my eyes  i lifted myhead and tried to look boldly round the dark room  at this moment alight gleamed on the wall  was it  i asked myself  a ray from the moonpenetrating some aperture in the blind  no  moonlight was still  andthis stirred  while i gazed  it glided up to the ceiling andquivered over my head  i can now conjecture readily that this streakof light was  in all likelihood  a gleam from a lantern carried bysome one across the lawn  but then  prepared as my mind was forhorror  shaken as my nerves were by agitation  i thought the swiftdarting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world  myheart beat thick  my head grew hot  a sound filled my ears  which ideemed the rushing of wings  something seemed near me  i wasoppressed  suffocated  endurance broke down  i rushed to the doorand shook the lock in desperate effort  steps came running along theouter passage  the key turned  bessie and abbot entered
miss eyre  are you ill   said bessie
what a dreadful noise  it went quite through me   exclaimed abbot
take me out  let me go into the nursery   was my cry
what for  are you hurt  have you seen something   again demandedbessie
oh  i saw a light  and i thought a ghost would come   i had nowgot hold of bessie s hand  and she did not snatch it from me
she has screamed out on purpose   declared abbot  in some disgust  and what a scream  if she had been in great pain one would haveexcused it  but she only wanted to bring us all here  i know hernaughty tricks
what is all this   demanded another voice peremptorily  and mrs reed came along the corridor  her cap flying wide  her gown rustlingstormily   abbot and bessie  i believe i gave orders that jane eyreshould be left in the red room till i came to her myself
miss jane screamed so loud  ma am   pleaded bessie
let her go   was the only answer   loose bessie s hand  child  youcannot succeed in getting out by these means  be assured  i abhorartifice  particularly in children  it is my duty to show you thattricks will not answer  you will now stay here an hour longer  andit is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that ishall liberate you then
o aunt  have pity  forgive me  i cannot endure it  let me bepunished some other way  i shall be killed if
silence  this violence is all most repulsive   and so  no doubt she felt it  i was a precocious actress in her eyes  she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions  mean spirit  anddangerous duplicity
bessie and abbot having retreated  mrs  reed  impatient of my nowfrantic anguish and wild sobs  abruptly thrust me back and locked mein  without farther parley  i heard her sweeping away  and soonafter she was gone  i suppose i had a species of fit unconsciousness closed the scene
chapter iii
the next thing i remember is  waking up with a feeling as if ihad had a frightful nightmare  and seeing before me a terrible redglare  crossed with thick black bars  i heard voices  too  speakingwith a hollow sound  and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water agitation  uncertainty  and an all predominating sense of terrorconfused my faculties  ere long  i became aware that some one washandling me  lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture  andthat more tenderly than i had ever been raised or upheld before  irested my head against a pillow or an arm  and felt easy
in five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved  i knewquite well that i was in my own bed  and that the red glare was thenursery fire  it was night  a candle burnt on the table  bessiestood at the bed foot with a basin in her hand  and a gentleman sat ina chair near my pillow  leaning over me
i felt an inexpressible relief  a soothing conviction of protectionand security  when i knew that there was a stranger in the room  anindividual not belonging to gateshead  and not related to mrs  reed turning from bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious tome than that of abbot  for instance  would have been)  i scrutinisedthe face of the gentleman  i knew him  it was mr  lloyd  anapothecary  sometimes called in by mrs  reed when the servants wereailing  for herself and the children she employed a physician
well  who am i   he asked
i pronounced his name  offering him at the same time my hand  hetook it  smiling and saying   we shall do very well by and by   thenhe laid me down  and addressing bessie  charged her to be very carefulthat i was not disturbed during the night  having given some furtherdirections  and intimated that he should call again the next day  hedeparted  to my grief  i felt so sheltered and befriended while he satin the chair near my pillow  and as he closed the door after him all the room darkened and my heart again sank  inexpressible sadnessweighed it down
do you feel as if you should sleep  miss   asked bessie  rathersoftly
scarcely dared i answer her  for i feared the next sentence mightbe rough   i will try
would you like to drink  or could you eat anything
no  thank you  bessie
then i think i shall go to bed  for it is past twelve o clock  butyou may call me if you want anything in the night
wonderful civility this  it emboldened me to ask a question
bessie  what is the matter with me  am i ill
you fell sick  i suppose  in the red room with crying  you ll bebetter soon  no doubt
bessie went into the housemaid s apartment  which was near  i heardher say
sarah  come and sleep with me in the nursery  i daren t for mylife be alone with that poor child tonight  she might die  it s such astrange thing she should have that fit  i wonder if she sawanything  missis was rather too hard
sarah came back with her  they both went to bed  they werewhispering together for half an hour before they fell asleep  i caughtscraps of their conversation  from which i was able only toodistinctly to infer the main subject discussed
something passed her  all dressed in white  and vanished    agreat black dog behind him    three loud raps on the chamber door   a light in the churchyard just over his grave   etc   etc
at last both slept  the fire and the candle went out  for me  thewatches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness  ear  eye and mind were alike strained by dread  such dread as children only canfeel
no severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of thered room  it only gave my nerves a shock of which i feel thereverberation to this day  yes  mrs  reed  to you i owe some fearfulpangs of mental suffering  but i ought to forgive you  for you knewnot what you did  while rending my heart strings  you thought you wereonly uprooting my bad propensities
next day  by noon  i was up and dressed  and sat wrapped in a shawlby the nursery hearth  i felt physically weak and broken down  butmy worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind  awretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears  no sooner hadi wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed  yet  ithought  i ought to have been happy  for none of the reeds were there they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama  abbot  too was sewing in another room  and bessie  as she moved hither andthither  putting away toys and arranging drawers  addressed to meevery now and then a word of unwonted kindness  this state of thingsshould have been to me a paradise of peace  accustomed as i was to alife of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging  but  in fact  myracked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe and no pleasure excite them agreeably
bessie had been down into the kitchen  and she brought up withher a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate  whose bird ofparadise  nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds  had beenwont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration  andwhich plate i had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand inorder to examine it more closely  but had always hitherto beendeemed unworthy of such a privilege  this precious vessel was nowplaced on my knee  and i was cordially invited to eat the circlet ofdelicate pastry upon it  vain favour  coming  like most otherfavours long deferred and often wished for  too late  i could noteat the tart  and the plumage of the bird  the tints of the flowers seemed strangely faded  i put both plate and tart away  bessie askedif i would have a book  the word book acted as a transient stimulus and i begged her to fetch gulliver s travels from the library  thisbook i had again and again perused with delight  i considered it anarrative of facts  and discovered in it a vein of interest deeperthan what i found in fairy tales  for as to the elves  having soughtthem in vain among fox glove leaves and bells  under mushrooms andbeneath the ground ivy mantling old wall nooks  i had at length madeup my mind to the sad truth  that they were all gone out of england tosome savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker  and thepopulation more scant  whereas  lilliput and brobdingnag being  inmy creed  solid parts of the earth s surface  i doubted not that imight one day  by taking a long voyage  see with my own eyes thelittle fields  houses  and trees  the diminutive people  the tinycows  sheep  and birds of the one realm  and the corn fields forest high  the mighty mastiffs  the monster cats  the tower like menand women  of the other  yet  when this cherished volume was nowplaced in my hand  when i turned over its leaves  and sought in itsmarvellous pictures the charm i had  till now  never failed to find all was eerie and dreary  the giants were gaunt goblins  the pigmiesmalevolent and fearful imps  gulliver a most desolate wanderer in mostdread and dangerous regions  i closed the book  which i dared nolonger peruse  and put it on the table  beside the untasted tart
bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room  and havingwashed her hands  she opened a certain little drawer  full of splendidshreds of silk and satin  and began making a new bonnet forgeorgiana s doll  meantime she sang  her song was
in the days when we were gipsying
a long time ago
i had often heard the song before  and always with livelydelight  for bessie had a sweet voice   at least  i thought so  butnow  though her voice was still sweet  i found in its melody anindescribable sadness  sometimes  preoccupied with her work  shesang the refrain very low  very lingeringly   a long time ago  cameout like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn  she passed intoanother ballad  this time a really doleful one
my feet they are sore  and my limbs they are weary
long is the way  and the mountains are wild
soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
over the path of the poor orphan child
why did they send me so far and so lonely
up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled
men are hard hearted  and kind angels only
watch o er the steps of a poor orphan child
yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing
clouds there are none  and clear stars beam mild
god  in his mercy  protection is showing
comfort and hope to the poor orphan child
ev n should i fall o er the broken bridge passing
or stray in the marshes  by false lights beguiled
still will my father  with promise and blessing
take to his bosom the poor orphan child
there is a thought that for strength should avail me
though both of shelter and kindred despoiled
heaven is a home  and a rest will not fail me
god is a friend to the poor orphan child
come  miss jane  don t cry   said bessie as she finished  shemight as well have said to the fire   don t burn   but how could shedivine the morbid suffering to which i was a prey  in the course ofthe morning mr  lloyd came again
what  already up   said he  as he entered the nursery   well nurse  how is she
bessie answered that i was doing very well
then she ought to look more cheerful  come here  mis jane  yourname is jane  is it not
yes  sir  jane eyre
well  you have been crying  miss jane eyre  can you tell me whatabout  have you any pain
no  sir
oh  i daresay she is crying because she could not go out withmissis in the carriage   interposed bessie
surely not  why  she is too old for such pettishness
i thought so too  and my self esteem being wounded by the falsecharge  i answered promptly   i never cried for such a thing in mylife  i hate going out in the carriage  i cry because i am miserable
oh fie  miss   said bessie
the good apothecary appeared a little puzzled  i was standingbefore him  he fixed his eyes on me very steadily  his eyes were smalland grey  not very bright  but i daresay i should think them shrewdnow  he had a hard featured yet good natured looking face  havingconsidered me at leisure  he said
what made you ill yesterday
she had a fall   said bessie  again putting in her word
fall  why  that is like a baby again  can t she manage to walkat her age  she must be eight or nine years old
i was knocked down   was the blunt explanation  jerked out of meby another pang of mortified pride   but that did not make me ill  i added  while mr  lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff
as he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket  a loud bellrang for the servants  dinner  he knew what it was   that s for you nurse   said he   you can go down  i ll give miss jane a lecturetill you come back
bessie would rather have stayed  but she was obliged to go  becausepunctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at gates head hall
the fall did not make you ill  what did  then   pursued mr lloyd when bessie was gone
i was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark
i saw mr  lloyd smile and frown at the same time   ghost  what  youare a baby after all  you are afraid of ghosts
of mr  reed s ghost i am  he died in that room  and was laid outthere  neither bessie nor any one else will go into it at night  ifthey can help it  and it was cruel to shut me up alone without acandle   so cruel that i think i shall never forget it
nonsense  and is it that makes you so miserable  are you afraidnow in daylight
no  but night will come again before long  and besides   i amunhappy   very unhappy  for other things
what other things  can you tell me some of them
how much i wished to reply fully to this question  how difficult itwas to frame any answer  children can feel  but they cannot analysetheir feelings  and if the analysis is partially effected inthought  they know not how to express the result of the process inwords  fearful  however  of losing this first and only opportunityof relieving my grief by imparting it  i  after a disturbed pause contrived to frame a meagre  though  as far as it went  true response
for one thing  i have no father or mother  brothers or sisters
you have a kind aunt and cousins
again i paused  then bunglingly enounced
but john reed knocked me down  and my aunt shut me up in thered room
mr  lloyd a second time produced his snuff box
don t you think gateshead hall a very beautiful house   askedhe   are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at
it is not my house  sir  and abbot says i have less right to behere than a servant
pooh  you can t be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendidplace
if i had anywhere else to go  i should be glad to leave it  buti can never get away from gateshead till i am a woman
perhaps you may  who knows  have you any relations besides mrs reed
i think not  sir
none belonging to your father
i don t know  i asked aunt reed once  and she said possibly imight have some poor  low relations called eyre  but she knewnothing about them
if you had such  would you like to go to them
i reflected  poverty looks grim to grown people  still more so tochildren  they have not much idea of industrious  working  respectablepoverty  they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes scanty food  fireless grates  rude manners  and debasing vices poverty for me was synonymous with degradation
no  i should not like to belong to poor people   was my reply
not even if they were kind to you
i shook my head  i could not see how poor people had the means ofbeing kind  and then to learn to speak like them  to adopt theirmanners  to be uneducated  to grow up like one of the poor women i sawsometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at thecottage doors of the village of gateshead  no  i was not heroic enoughto purchase liberty at the price of caste
but are your relatives so very poor  are they working people
i cannot tell  aunt reed says if i have any  they must be abeggarly set  i should not like to go a begging
would you like to go to school
again i reflected  i scarcely knew what school was  bessiesometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks wore backboards  and were expected to be exceedingly genteel andprecise  john reed hated his school  and abused his master  but johnreed s tastes were no rule for mine  and if bessie s accounts ofschool discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family whereshe had lived before coming to gateshead) were somewhat appalling  herdetails of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladieswere  i thought  equally attractive  she boasted of beautifulpaintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed  of songs theycould sing and pieces they could play  of purses they could net  offrench books they could translate  till my spirit was moved toemulation as i listened  besides  school would be a complete change it implied a long journey  an entire separation from gateshead  anentrance into a new life
i should indeed like to go to school   was the audibleconclusion of my musings
well  well  who knows what may happen   said mr  lloyd  as hegot up   the child ought to have change of air and scene   he added speaking to himself   nerves not in a good state
bessie now returned  at the same moment the carriage was heardrolling up the gravel walk
is that your mistress  nurse   asked mr  lloyd   i should liketo speak to her before i go
bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast room  and led the wayout  in the interview which followed between him and mrs  reed  ipresume  from after occurrences  that the apothecary ventured torecommend my being sent to school  and the recommendation was no doubtreadily enough adopted  for as abbot said  in discussing the subjectwith bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night  after i wasin bed  and  as they thought  asleep   missis was  she dared say  gladenough to get rid of such a tiresome  ill conditioned child  whoalways looked as if she were watching everybody  and scheming plotsunderhand   abbot  i think  gave me credit for being a sort ofinfantine guy fawkes
on that same occasion i learned  for the first time  from missabbot s communications to bessie  that my father had been a poorclergyman  that my mother had married him against the wishes of herfriends  who considered the match beneath her  that my grandfatherreed was so irritated at her disobedience  he cut her off without ashilling  that after my mother and father had been married a year  thelatter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of alarge manufacturing town where his curacy was situated  and where thatdisease was then prevalent  that my mother took the infection fromhim  and both died within a month of each other
bessie  when she heard this narrative  sighed and said   poormiss jane is to be pitied too  abbot
yes   responded abbot   if she were a nice  pretty child  onemight compassionate her forlornness  but one really cannot care forsuch a little toad as that
not a great deal  to be sure   agreed bessie   at any rate  abeauty like miss georgiana would be more moving in the samecondition
yes  i doat on miss georgiana   cried the fervent abbot   littledarling   with her long curls and her blue eyes  and such a sweetcolour as she has  just as if she were painted   bessie  i could fancya welsh rabbit for supper
so could i  with a roast onion  come  we ll go down   they went
chapter iv
from my discourse with mr  lloyd  and from the above reportedconference between bessie and abbot  i gathered enough of hope tosuffice as a motive for wishing to get well  a change seemed near  i desired and waited it in silence  it tarried  however  days andweeks passed  i had regained my normal state of health  but no newallusion was made to the subject over which i brooded  mrs  reedsurveyed me at times with a severe eye  but seldom addressed me  sincemy illness  she had drawn a more marked line of separation than everbetween me and her own children  appointing me a small closet to sleepin by myself  condemning me to take my meals alone  and pass all mytime in the nursery  while my cousins were constantly in thedrawing room  not a hint  however  did she drop about sending me toschool  still i felt an instinctive certainty that she would notlong endure me under the same roof with her  for her glance  nowmore than ever  when turned on me  expressed an insuperable and rootedaversion
eliza and georgiana  evidently acting according to orders  spoke tome as little as possible  john thrust his tongue in his cheek wheneverhe saw me  and once attempted chastisement  but as i instantlyturned against him  roused by the same sentiment of deep ire anddesperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before  he thought itbetter to desist  and ran from me uttering execrations  and vowing ihad burst his nose  i had indeed levelled at that prominent feature ashard a blow as my knuckles could inflict  and when i saw that eitherthat or my look daunted him  i had the greatest inclination tofollow up my advantage to purpose  but he was already with his mama  iheard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how  that nastyjane eyre  had flown at him like a mad cat  he was stopped ratherharshly
don t talk to me about her  john  i told you not to go near her she is not worthy of notice  i do not choose that either you or yoursisters should associate with her
here  leaning over the banister  i cried out suddenly  andwithout at all deliberating on my words
they are not fit to associate with me
mrs  reed was rather a stout woman  but  on hearing this strangeand audacious declaration  she ran nimbly up the stair  swept melike a whirlwind into the nursery  and crushing me down on the edge ofmy crib  dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place  orutter one syllable during the remainder of the day
what would uncle reed say to you  if he were alive   was myscarcely voluntary demand  i say scarcely voluntary  for it seemedas if my tongue pronounced words  without my will consenting totheir utterance  something spoke out of me over which i had nocontrol
what   said mrs  reed under her breath  her usually coldcomposed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear  she tookher hand from my arm  and gazed at me as if she really did not knowwhether i were child or fiend  i was now in for it
my uncle reed is in heaven  and can see all you do and think and so can papa and mama  they know how you shut me up all day long and how you wish me dead
mrs  reed soon rallied her spirits  she shook me most soundly she boxed both my ears  and then left me without a word  bessiesupplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour s length  in which sheproved beyond a doubt that i was the most wicked and abandoned childever reared under a roof  i half believed her  for i felt indeedonly bad feelings surging in my breast
november  december  and half of january passed away  christmasand the new year had been celebrated at gateshead with the usualfestive cheer  presents had been interchanged  dinners and eveningparties given  from every enjoyment i was  of course  excluded  myshare of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling ofeliza and georgiana  and seeing them descend to the drawing room dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes  with hairelaborately ringleted  and afterwards  in listening to the sound ofthe piano or the harp played below  to the passing to and fro of thebutler and footman  to the jingling of glass and china as refreshmentswere handed  to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing roomdoor opened and closed  when tired of this occupation  i wouldretire from the stair head to the solitary and silent nursery there  though somewhat sad  i was not miserable  to speak truth  i hadnot the least wish to go into company  for in company i was veryrarely noticed  and if bessie had but been kind and companionable  ishould have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly withher  instead of passing them under the formidable eye of mrs  reed  ina room full of ladies and gentlemen  but bessie  as soon as she haddressed her young ladies  used to take herself off to the livelyregions of the kitchen and housekeeper s room  generally bearing thecandle along with her  i then sat with my doll on my knee till thefire got low  glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothingworse than myself haunted the shadowy room  and when the embers sankto a dull red  i undressed hastily  tugging at knots and strings asi best might  and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib  tothis crib i always took my doll  human beings must love something and  in the dearth of worthier objects of affection  i contrived tofind a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image shabby as a miniature scarecrow  it puzzles me now to remember withwhat absurd sincerity i doated on this little toy  half fancying italive and capable of sensation  i could not sleep unless it was foldedin my night gown  and when it lay there safe and warm  i wascomparatively happy  believing it to be happy likewise
long did the hours seem while i waited the departure of thecompany  and listened for the sound of bessie s step on the stairs sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or herscissors  or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper  a bunor a cheese cake  then she would sit on the bed while i ate it  andwhen i had finished  she would tuck the clothes round me  and twiceshe kissed me  and said   good night  miss jane   when thus gentle bessie seemed to me the best  prettiest  kindest being in the world and i wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant andamiable  and never push me about  or scold  or task me unreasonably as she was too often wont to do  bessie  lee must  i think  havebeen a girl of good natural capacity  for she was smart in all shedid  and had a remarkable knack of narrative  so  at least  i judgefrom the impression made on me by her nursery tales  she was prettytoo  if my recollections of her face and person are correct  iremember her as a slim young woman  with black hair  dark eyes  verynice features  and good  clear complexion  but she had a capriciousand hasty temper  and indifferent ideas of principle or justice still  such as she was  i preferred her to any one else at gatesheadhall
it was the fifteenth of january  about nine o clock in the morning bessie was gone down to breakfast  my cousins had not yet beensummoned to their mama  eliza was putting on her bonnet and warmgarden coat to go and feed her poultry  an occupation of which she wasfond  and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper andhoarding up the money she thus obtained  she had a turn for traffic and a marked propensity for saving  shown not only in the vending ofeggs and chickens  but also in driving hard bargains with the gardenerabout flower roots  seeds  and slips of plants  that functionaryhaving orders from mrs  reed to buy of his young lady all the productsof her parterre she wished to sell  and eliza would have sold the hairoff her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby  as toher money  she first secreted it in odd corners  wrapped in a rag oran old curl paper  but some of these hoards having been discoveredby the housemaid  eliza  fearful of one day losing her valuedtreasure  consented to intrust it to her mother  at a usurious rate ofinterest  fifty or sixty per cent   which interest she exacted everyquarter  keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy
georgiana sat on a high stool  dressing her hair at the glass and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic  i wasmaking my bed  having received strict orders from bessie to get itarranged before she returned  (for bessie now frequently employed meas a sort of under nurserymaid  to tidy the room  dust the chairs etc )  having spread the quilt and folded my night dress  i went tothe window seat to put in order some picture books and doll s housefurniture scattered there  an abrupt command from georgiana to let herplaythings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors  the fairy platesand cups  were her property) stopped my proceedings  and then  forlack of other occupation  i fell to breathing on the frost flowerswith which the window was fretted  and thus clearing a space in theglass through which i might look out on the grounds  where all wasstill and petrified under the influence of a hard frost
from this window were visible the porter s lodge and thecarriage road  and just as i had dissolved so much of the silver whitefoliage veiling the panes as left room to look out  i saw the gatesthrown open and a carriage roll through  i watched it ascending thedrive with indifference  carriages often came to gateshead  but noneever brought visitors in whom i was interested  it stopped in front ofthe house  the door bell rang loudly  the new comer was admitted all this being nothing to me  my vacant attention soon foundlivelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin  whichcame and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry tree nailedagainst the wall near the casement  the remains of my breakfast ofbread and milk stood on the table  and having crumbled a morsel ofroll  i was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on thewindow sill  when bessie came running upstairs into the nursery
miss jane  take off your pinafore  what are you doing there have you washed your hands and face this morning   i gave anothertug before i answered  for i wanted the bird to be secure of itsbread  the sash yielded  i scattered the crumbs  some on the stonesill  some on the cherry tree bough  then  closing the window  ireplied
no  bessie  i have only just finished dusting
troublesome  careless child  and what are you doing now  youlook quite red  as if you have been about some mischief  what were youopening the window for
i was spared the trouble of answering  for bessie seemed in toogreat a hurry to listen to explanations  she hauled me to thewashstand  inflicted a merciless  but happily brief scrub on my faceand hands with soap  water  and a coarse towel  disciplined my headwith a bristly brush  denuded me of my pinafore  and then hurryingme to the top of the stairs  bid me go down directly  as i waswanted in the breakfast room
i would have asked who wanted me  i would have demanded if mrs reed was there  but bessie was already gone  and had closed thenursery door upon me  i slowly descended  for nearly three months  ihad never been called to mrs  reed s presence  restricted so long tothe nursery  the breakfast  dining  and drawing rooms were becomefor me awful regions  on which it dismayed me to intrude
i now stood in the empty hall  before me was the breakfast roomdoor  and i stopped  intimidated and trembling  what a miserablelittle poltroon had fear  engendered of unjust punishment  made ofme in those days  i feared to return to the nursery  and feared togo forward to the parlour  ten minutes i stood in agitated hesitation the vehement ringing of the breakfast room bell decided me  i mustenter
who could want me   i asked inwardly  as with both hands iturned the stiff door handle  which  for a second or two  resistedmy efforts   what should i see besides aunt reed in the apartment  a man or a woman   the handle turned  the door unclosed  and passingthrough and curtseying low  i looked up at  a black pillar   such at least  appeared to me  at first sight  the straight  narrow sable clad shape standing erect on the rug  the grim face at the topwas like a carved mask  placed above the shaft by way of capital
mrs  reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside  she made asignal to me to approach  i did so  and she introduced me to the stonystranger with the words   this is the little girl respecting whom iapplied to you
he  for it was a man  turned his head slowly towards where i stood and having examined me with the two inquisitive looking grey eyeswhich twinkled under a pair of bushy brows  said solemnly  and in abass voice   her size is small  what is her age
ten years
so much   was the doubtful answer  and he prolonged his scrutinyfor some minutes  presently he addressed me
your name  little girl
jane eyre  sir
in uttering these words i looked up  he seemed to me a tallgentleman  but then i was very little  his features were large  andthey and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim
well  jane eyre  and are you a good child
impossible to reply to this in the affirmative  my little worldheld a contrary opinion  i was silent  mrs  reed answered for me by anexpressive shake of the head  adding soon   perhaps the less said onthat subject the better  mr  brocklehurst
sorry indeed to hear it  she and i must have some talk   andbending from the perpendicular  he installed his person in thearm chair opposite mrs  reed s   come here   he said
i stepped across the rug  he placed me square and straight beforehim  what a face he had  now that it was almost on a level withmine  what a great nose  and what a mouth  and what large prominentteeth
no sight so sad as that of a naughty child   he began   especiallya naughty little girl  do you know where the wicked go after death
they go to hell   was my ready and orthodox answer
and what is hell  can you tell me that
a pit full of fire
and should you like to fall into that pit  and to be burning therefor ever
no  sir
what must you do to avoid it
i deliberated a moment  my answer  when it did come  wasobjectionable   i must keep in good health  and not die
how can you keep in good health  children younger than you diedaily  i buried a little child of five years old only a day or twosince   a good little child  whose soul is now in heaven  it is tobe feared the same could not be said of you were you to be calledhence
not being in a condition to remove his doubt  i only cast my eyesdown on the two large feet planted on the rug  and sighed  wishingmyself far enough away
i hope that sigh is from the heart  and that you repent of everhaving been the occasion of discomfort to your excellentbenefactress
benefactress  benefactress   said i inwardly   they all callmrs  reed my benefactress  if so  a benefactress is a disagreeablething
do you say your prayers night and morning   continued myinterrogator
yes  sir
do you read your bible
sometimes
with pleasure  are you fond of it
i like revelations  and the book of daniel  and genesis andsamuel  and a little bit of exodus  and some parts of kings andchronicles  and job and jonah
and the psalms  i hope you like them
no  sir
no  oh  shocking  i have a little boy  younger than you  who knowssix psalms by heart  and when you ask him which he would ratherhave  a gingerbread nut to eat or a verse of a psalm to learn  hesays  "oh  the verse of a psalm  angels sing psalms " says he  "i wishto be a little angel here below " he then gets two nuts inrecompense for his infant piety
psalms are not interesting   i remarked
that proves you have a wicked heart  and you must pray to god tochange it  to give you a new and clean one  to take away your heart ofstone and give you a heart of flesh
i was about to propound a question  touching the manner in whichthat operation of changing my heart was to be performed  when mrs reed interposed  telling me to sit down  she then proceeded to carryon the conversation herself
mr  brocklehurst  i believe i intimated in the letter which iwrote to you three weeks ago  that this little girl has not quitethe character and disposition i could wish  should you admit herinto lowood school  i should be glad if the superintendent andteachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her  and  above all to guard against her worst fault  a tendency to deceit  i mention thisin your hearing  jane  that you may not attempt to impose on mr brocklehurst
well might i dread  well might i dislike mrs  reed  for it washer nature to wound me cruelly  never was i happy in her presence however carefully i obeyed  however strenuously i strove to pleaseher  my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences asthe above  now  uttered before a stranger  the accusation cut me tothe heart  i dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hopefrom the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter  ifelt  though i could not have expressed the feeling  that she wassowing aversion and unkindness along my future path  i saw myselftransformed under mr  brocklehurst s eye into an artful  noxiouschild  and what could i do to remedy the injury
nothing  indeed   thought i  as i struggled to repress a sob and hastily wiped away some tears  the impotent evidences of myanguish
deceit is  indeed  a sad fault in a child   said mr  brocklehurst  it is akin to falsehood  and all liars will have their portion in thelake burning with fire and brimstone  she shall  however  bewatched  mrs  reed  i will speak to miss temple and the teachers
i should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting herprospects   continued my benefactress   to be made useful  to bekept humble  as for the vacations  she will  with your permission spend them always at lowood
your decisions are perfectly judicious  madam   returned mr brocklehurst   humility is a christian grace  and one peculiarlyappropriate to the pupils of lowood  i  therefore  direct thatespecial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them  ihave studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment ofpride  and  only the other day  i had a pleasing proof of mysuccess  my second daughter  augusta  went with her mama to visitthe school  and on her return she exclaimed  "oh  dear papa  how quietand plain all the girls at lowood look  with their hair combedbehind their ears  and their long pinafores  and those littleholland pockets outside their frocks  they are almost like poorpeople s children  and " said she  "they looked at my dress andmama s  as if they had never seen a silk gown before "
this is the state of things i quite approve   returned mrs reed   had i sought all england over  i could scarcely have found asystem more exactly fitting a child like jane eyre  consistency  mydear mr  brocklehurst  i advocate consistency in all things
consistency  madam  is the first of christian duties  and it hasbeen observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment oflowood  plain fare  simple attire  unsophisticated accommodations hardy and active habits  such is the order of the day in the house andits inhabitants
quite right  sir  i may then depend upon this child being receivedas a pupil at lowood  and there being trained in conformity to herposition and prospects
madam  you may  she shall be placed in that nursery of chosenplants  and i trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimableprivilege of her election
i will send her  then  as soon as possible  mr  brocklehurst  for i assure you  i feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility thatwas becoming too irksome
no doubt  no doubt  madam  and now i wish you good morning  ishall return to brocklehurst hall in the course of a week or two  mygood friend  the archdeacon  will not permit me to leave him sooner  ishall send miss temple notice that she is to expect a new girl  sothat there will be no difficulty about receiving her  good bye
good bye  mr  brocklehurst  remember me to mrs  and missbrocklehurst  and to augusta and theodore  and master broughtonbrocklehurst
i will  madam  little girl  here is a book entitled the child sguide  read it with prayer  especially that part containing "anaddicted to falsehood and deceit "
with these words mr  brocklehurst put into my hand a thinpamphlet sewn in a cover  and having rung for his carriage  hedeparted
mrs  reed and i were left alone  some minutes passed in silence she was sewing  i was watching her  mrs  reed might be at that timesome six or seven and thirty  she was a woman of robust frame square shouldered and strong limbed  not tall  and  though stout not obese  she had a somewhat large face  the under jaw being muchdeveloped and very solid  her brow was low  her chin large andprominent  mouth and nose sufficiently regular  under her lighteyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth  her skin was dark andopaque  her hair nearly flaxen  her constitution was sound as abell  illness never came near her  she was an exact  clever manager her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control  herchildren only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn she dressed well  and had a presence and port calculated to set offhandsome attire
sitting on a low stool  a few yards from her arm chair  iexamined her figure  i perused her features  in my hand i held thetract containing the sudden death of the liar  to which narrative myattention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning  what had justpassed  what mrs  reed had said concerning me to mr  brocklehurst  thewhole tenor of their conversation  was recent  raw  and stinging in mymind  i had felt every word as acutely as i had heard it plainly and a passion of resentment fomented now within me
mrs  reed looked up from her work  her eye settled on mine  herfingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements
go out of the room  return to the nursery   was her mandate  mylook or something else must have struck her as offensive  for shespoke with extreme though suppressed irritation  i got up  i went tothe door  i came back again  i walked to the window  across theroom  then close up to her
speak i must  i had been trodden on severely  and must turn  buthow  what strength had i to dart retaliation at my antagonist  igathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence
i am not deceitful  if i were  i should say i loved you  but ideclare i do not love you  i dislike you the worst of anybody in theworld except john reed  and this book about the liar  you may giveto your girl  georgiana  for it is she who tells lies  and not i
mrs  reed s hands still lay on her work inactive  her eye of icecontinued to dwell freezingly on mine
what more have you to say   she asked  rather in the tone in whicha person might address an opponent of adult age than such as isordinarily used to a child
that eye of hers  that voice stirred every antipathy i had  shakingfrom head to foot  thrilled with ungovernable excitement  i continued
i am glad you are no relation of mine  i will never call youaunt again so long as i live  i will never come to see you when i amgrown up  and if any one asks me how i liked you  and how youtreated me  i will say the very thought of you makes me sick  and thatyou treated me with miserable cruelty
how dare you affirm that  jane eyre
how dare i  mrs  reed  how dare i  because it is the truth  youthink i have no feelings  and that i can do without one bit of love orkindness  but i cannot live so  and you have no pity  i shall rememberhow you thrust me back  roughly and violently thrust me back  into thered room  and locked me up there  to my dying day  though i was inagony  though i cried out  while suffocating with distress  "havemercy  have mercy  aunt reed " and that punishment you made mesuffer because your wicked boy struck me  knocked me down for nothing i will tell anybody who asks me questions  this exact tale  peoplethink you a good woman  but you are bad  hard hearted  you aredeceitful
ere i had finished this reply  my soul began to expand  to exult with the strangest sense of freedom  of triumph  i ever felt  itseemed as if an invisible bond had burst  and that i had struggled outinto unhoped for liberty  not without cause was this sentiment  mrs reed looked frightened  her work had slipped from her knee  she waslifting up her hands  rocking herself to and fro  and even twistingher face as if she would cry
jane  you are under a mistake  what is the matter with you  why doyou tremble so violently  would you like to drink some water
no  mrs  reed
is there anything else you wish for  jane  i assure you  idesire to be your friend
not you  you told mr  brocklehurst i had a bad character  adeceitful disposition  and i ll let everybody at lowood know whatyou are  and what you have done
jane  you don t understand these things  children must becorrected for their faults
deceit is not my fault   i cried out in a savage  high voice
but you are passionate  jane  that you must allow  and nowreturn to the nursery  there s a dear  and lie down a little
i am not your dear  i cannot lie down  send me to school soon mrs  reed  for i hate to live here
i will indeed send her to school soon   murmured mrs  reed sottovoce  and gathering up her work  she abruptly quitted the apartment
i was left there alone  winner of the field  it was the hardestbattle i had fought  and the first victory i had gained  i stoodawhile on the rug  where mr  brocklehurst had stood  and i enjoyedmy conqueror s solitude  first  i smiled to myself and felt elate  butthis fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the acceleratedthrob of my pulses  a child cannot quarrel with its elders  as i haddone  cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play  as i hadgiven mine  without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse andthe chill of reaction  a ridge of lighted heath  alive  glancing devouring  would have been a meet emblem of my mind when i accused andmenaced mrs  reed  the same ridge  black and blasted after theflames are dead  would have represented as meetly my subsequentcondition  when half an hour s silence and reflection had shown me themadness of my conduct  and the dreariness of my hated and hatingposition
something of vengeance i had tasted for the first time  as aromaticwine it seemed  on swallowing  warm and racy  its after flavour metallic and corroding  gave me a sensation as if i had been poisoned willingly would i now have gone and asked mrs  reed s pardon  but iknew  partly from experience and partly from instinct  that was theway to make her repulse me with double scorn  thereby re excitingevery turbulent impulse of my nature
i would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fiercespeaking  fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling thanthat of sombre indignation  i took a book  some arabian tales  i satdown and endeavoured to read  i could make no sense of the subject  myown thoughts swam always between me and the page i had usually foundfascinating  i opened the glass door in the breakfast room  theshrubbery was quite still  the black frost reigned  unbroken by sun orbreeze  through the grounds  i covered my head and arms with the skirtof my frock  and went out to walk in a part of the plantation whichwas quite sequestered  but i found no pleasure in the silent trees the falling fir cones  the congealed relics of autumn  russetleaves  swept by past winds in heaps  and now stiffened together  ileaned against a gate  and looked into an empty field where no sheepwere feeding  where the short grass was nipped and blanched  it wasa very grey day  a most opaque sky   onding on snaw   canopied all thence flakes fell at intervals  which settled on the hard path and onthe hoary lea without melting  i stood  a wretched child enough whispering to myself over and over again   what shall i do   whatshall i do
all at once i heard a clear voice call   miss jane  where areyou  come to lunch
it was bessie  i knew well enough  but i did not stir  her lightstep came tripping down the path
you naughty little thing   she said   why don t you come whenyou are called
bessie s presence  compared with the thoughts over which i had beenbrooding  seemed cheerful  even though  as usual  she was somewhatcross  the fact is  after my conflict with and victory over mrs  reed i was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid s transitoryanger  and i was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness ofheart  i just put my two arms round her and said   come  bessie  don tscold
the action was more frank and fearless than any i was habituated toindulge in  somehow it pleased her
you are a strange child  miss jane   she said  as she lookeddown at me   a little roving  solitary thing  and you are going toschool  i suppose
i nodded
and won t you be sorry to leave poor bessie
what does bessie care for me  she is always scolding me
because you re such a queer  frightened  shy little thing  youshould be bolder
what  to get more knocks
nonsense  but you are rather put upon  that s certain  my mothersaid  when she came to see me last week  that she would not like alittle one of her own to be in your place   now  come in  and i vesome good news for you
i don t think you have  bessie
child  what do you mean  what sorrowful eyes you fix on me well  but missis and the young ladies and master john are going out totea this afternoon  and you shall have tea with me  i ll ask cook tobake you a little cake  and then you shall help me to look over yourdrawers  for i am soon to pack your trunk  missis intends you to leavegateshead in a day or two  and you shall choose what toys you liketo take with you
bessie  you must promise not to scold me any more till i go
well  i will  but mind you are a very good girl  and don t beafraid of me  don t start when i chance to speak rather sharply it s so provoking
i don t think i shall ever be afraid of you again  bessie  becausei have got used to you  and i shall soon have another set of people todread
if you dread them they ll dislike you
as you do  bessie
i don t dislike you  miss  i believe i am fonder of you than ofall the others
you don t show it
you little sharp thing  you ve got quite a new way of talking what makes you so venturesome and hardy
why  i shall soon be away from you  and besides   i was going tosay something about what had passed between me and mrs  reed  but onsecond thoughts i considered it better to remain silent on that head
and so you re glad to leave me
not at all  bessie  indeed  just now i m rather sorry
just now  and rather  how coolly my little lady says it  i daresaynow if i were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn t give it me  you d sayyou d rather not
i ll kiss you and welcome  bend your head down   bessie stooped we mutually embraced  and i followed her into the house quitecomforted  that afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony  and in theevening bessie told me some of her most enchaining stories  and sangme some of her sweetest songs  even for me life had its gleams ofsunshine
chapter v
five o clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th ofjanuary  when bessie brought a candle into my closet and found mealready up and nearly dressed  i had risen half an hour before herentrance  and had washed my face  and put on my clothes by the lightof a half moon just setting  whose rays streamed through the narrowwindow near my crib  i was to leave gateshead that day by a coachwhich passed the lodge gates at six a m  bessie was the only personyet risen  she had lit a fire in the nursery  where she nowproceeded to make my breakfast  few children can eat when excited withthe thoughts of a journey  nor could i  bessie  having pressed me invain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she hadprepared for me  wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them intomy bag  then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet  and wrappingherself in a shawl  she and i left the nursery  as we passed mrs reed s bedroom  she said   will you go in and bid missis good bye
no  bessie  she came to my crib last night when you were gone downto supper  and said i need not disturb her in the morning  or mycousins either  and she told me to remember that she had always beenmy best friend  and to speak of her and be grateful to heraccordingly
what did you say  miss
nothing  i covered my face with the bedclothes  and turned fromher to the wall
that was wrong  miss jane
it was quite right  bessie  your missis has not been my friend she has been my foe
o miss jane  don t say so
good bye to gateshead   cried i  as we passed through the hall andwent out at the front door
the moon was set  and it was very dark  bessie carried a lantern whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recentthaw  raw and chill was the winter morning  my teeth chattered as ihastened down the drive  there was a light in the porter s lodge  whenwe reached it  we found the porter s wife just kindling her fire  mytrunk  which had been carried down the evening before  stood corded atthe door  it wanted but a few minutes of six  and shortly after thathour had struck  the distant roll of wheels announced the comingcoach  i went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidlythrough the gloom
is she going by herself   asked the porter s wife
yes
and how far is it
fifty miles
what a long way  i wonder mrs  reed is not afraid to trust herso far alone
the coach drew up  there it was at the gates with its four horsesand its top laden with passengers  the guard and coachman loudly urgedhaste  my trunk was hoisted up  i was taken from bessie s neck  towhich i clung with kisses
be sure and take good care of her   cried she to the guard  ashe lifted me into the inside
ay  ay   was the answer  the door was slapped to  a voiceexclaimed  all right   and on we drove  thus was i severed from bessieand gateshead  thus whirled away to unknown  and  as i then deemed remote and mysterious regions
i remember but little of the journey  i only know that the dayseemed to me of a preternatural length  and that we appeared to travelover hundreds of miles of road  we passed through several towns  andin one  a very large one  the coach stopped  the horses were takenout  and the passengers alighted to dine  i was carried into an inn where the guard wanted me to have some dinner  but  as i had noappetite  he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at eachend  a chandelier pendent from the ceiling  and a little red galleryhigh up against the wall filled with musical instruments  here iwalked about for a long time  feeling very strange  and mortallyapprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me  for i believedin kidnappers  their exploits having frequently figured in bessie sfireside chronicles  at last the guard returned  once more i wasstowed away in the coach  my protector mounted his own seat  sounded
the afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty  as it waned intodusk  i began to feel that we were getting very far indeed fromgateshead  we ceased to pass through towns  the country changed  greatgrey hills heaved up round the horizon  as twilight deepened  wedescended a valley  dark with wood  and long after night hadoverclouded the prospect  i heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees
lulled by the sound  i at last dropped asleep  i had not longslumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me  the coach doorwas open  and a person like a servant was standing at it  i saw herface and dress by the light of the lamps
is there a little girl called jane eyre here   she asked  ianswered  yes   and was then lifted out  my trunk was handed down  andthe coach instantly drove away
i was stiff with long sitting  and bewildered with the noise andmotion of the coach  gathering my faculties  i looked about me rain  wind  and darkness filled the air  nevertheless  i dimlydiscerned a wall before me and a door open in it  through this doori passed with my new guide  she shut and locked it behind her  therewas now visible a house or houses  for the building spread far  withmany windows  and lights burning in some  we went up a broad pebblypath  splashing wet  and were admitted at a door  then the servant ledme through a passage into a room with a fire  where she left me alone
i stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze  then ilooked round  there was no candle  but the uncertain light from thehearth showed  by intervals  papered walls  carpet  curtains shining mahogany furniture  it was a parlour  not so spacious orsplendid as the drawing room at gateshead  but comfortable enough  iwas puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall  whenthe door opened  and an individual carrying a light entered  anotherfollowed close behind
the first was a tall lady with dark hair  dark eyes  and a pale andlarge forehead  her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl  hercountenance was grave  her bearing erect
the child is very young to be sent alone   said she  putting hercandle down on the table  she considered me attentively for a minuteor two  then further added
she had better be put to bed soon  she looks tired  are youtired   she asked  placing her hand on my shoulder
a little  ma am
and hungry too  no doubt  let her have some supper before she goesto bed  miss miller  is this the first time you have left your parentsto come to school  my little girl
i explained to her that i had no parents  she inquired how longthey had been dead  then how old i was  what was my name  whether icould read  write  and sew a little  then she touched my cheekgently with her forefinger  and saying   she hoped i should be agood child   dismissed me along with miss miller
the lady i had left might be about twenty nine  the one who wentwith me appeared some years younger  the first impressed me by hervoice  look  and air  miss miller was more ordinary  ruddy incomplexion  though of a careworn countenance  hurried in gait andaction  like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand  shelooked  indeed  what i afterwards found she really was  anunder teacher  led by her  i passed from compartment to compartment from passage to passage  of a large and irregular building  till emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading thatportion of the house we had traversed  we came upon the hum of manyvoices  and presently entered a wide  long room  with great dealtables  two at each end  on each of which burnt a pair of candles  andseated all round on benches  a congregation of girls of every age from nine or ten to twenty  seen by the dim light of the dips  theirnumber to me appeared countless  though not in reality exceedingeighty  they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaintfashion  and long holland pinafores  it was the hour of study  theywere engaged in conning over their to morrow s task  and the hum i hadheard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions
miss miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door  thenwalking up to the top of the long room she cried out
monitors  collect the lesson books and put them away
four tall girls arose from different tables  and going round gathered the books and removed them  miss miller again gave the wordof command
monitors  fetch the supper trays
the tall girls went out and returned presently  each bearing atray  with portions of something  i knew not what  arranged thereon and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray  theportions were handed round  those who liked took a draught of thewater  the mug being common to all  when it came to my turn  idrank  for i was thirsty  but did not touch the food  excitement andfatigue rendering me incapable of eating  i now saw  however  thatit was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments
the meal over  prayers were read by miss miller  and the classesfiled off  two and two  upstairs  overpowered by this time withweariness  i scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was except that  like the schoolroom  i saw it was very long  to night iwas to be miss miller s bed fellow  she helped me to undress  whenlaid down i glanced at the long rows of beds  each of which wasquickly filled with two occupants  in ten minutes the single light wasextinguished  and amidst silence and complete darkness i fell asleep
the night passed rapidly  i was too tired even to dream  i onlyonce awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts  and the rain fallin torrents  and to be sensible that miss miller had taken her placeby my side  when i again unclosed my eyes  a loud bell was ringing the girls were up and dressing  day had not yet begun to dawn  and arushlight or two burned in the room  i too rose reluctantly  it wasbitter cold  and i dressed as well as i could for shivering  andwashed when there was a basin at liberty  which did not occur soon  asthere was but one basin to six girls  on the stands down the middle ofthe room  again the bell rang  all formed in file  two and two  and inthat order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly litschoolroom  here prayers were read by miss miller  afterwards shecalled out
form classes
a great tumult succeeded for some minutes  during which miss millerrepeatedly exclaimed   silence   and  order   when it subsided  isaw them all drawn up in four semicircles  before four chairs placed at the four tables  all held books in their hands  and agreat book  like a bible  lay on each table  before the vacant seat  apause of some seconds succeeded  filled up by the low  vague hum ofnumbers  miss miller walked from class to class  hushing thisindefinite sound
a distant bell tinkled  immediately three ladies entered theroom  each walked to a table and took her seat  miss miller assumedthe fourth vacant chair  which was that nearest the door  and aroundwhich the smallest of the children were assembled  to this inferiorclass i was called  and placed at the bottom of it
business now began  the day s collect was repeated  then certaintexts of scripture were said  and to these succeeded a protractedreading of chapters in the bible  which lasted an hour  by the timethat exercise was terminated  day had fully dawned  theindefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time  the classes weremarshalled and marched into another room to breakfast  how glad iwas to behold a prospect of getting something to eat  i was now nearlysick from inanition  having taken so little the day before
the refectory was a great  low ceiled  gloomy room  on two longtables smoked basins of something hot  which  however  to my dismay sent forth an odour far from inviting  i saw a universal manifestationof discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of thosedestined to swallow it  from the van of the procession  the tall girlsof the first class  rose the whispered words
disgusting  the porridge is burnt again
silence   ejaculated a voice  not that of miss miller  but oneof the upper teachers  a little and dark personage  smartly dressed but of somewhat morose aspect  who installed herself at the top of onetable  while a more buxom lady presided at the other  i looked in vainfor her i had first seen the night before  she was not visible  missmiller occupied the foot of the table where i sat  and a strange foreign looking  elderly lady  the french teacher  as i afterwardsfound  took the corresponding seat at the other board  a long gracewas said and a hymn sung  then a servant brought in some tea for theteachers  and the meal began
ravenous  and now very faint  i devoured a spoonful or two of myportion without thinking of its taste  but the first edge of hungerblunted  i perceived i had got in hand a nauseous mess  burnt porridgeis almost as bad as rotten potatoes  famine itself soon sickens overit  the spoons were moved slowly  i saw each girl taste her food andtry to swallow it  but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished breakfast was over  and none had breakfasted  thanks being returnedfor what we had not got  and a second hymn chanted  the refectorywas evacuated for the schoolroom  i was one of the last to go out  andin passing the tables  i saw one teacher take a basin of theporridge and taste it  she looked at the others  all theircountenances expressed displeasure  and one of them  the stout one whispered
abominable stuff  how shameful
a quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began  duringwhich the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult  for that space oftime it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely  andthey used their privilege  the whole conversation ran on thebreakfast  which one and all abused roundly  poor things  it was thesole consolation they had  miss miller was now the only teacher in theroom  a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious andsullen gestures  i heard the name of mr  brocklehurst pronounced bysome lips  at which miss miller shook her head disapprovingly  but shemade no great effort to check the general wrath  doubtless sheshared in it
a clock in the schoolroom struck nine  miss miller left her circle and standing in the middle of the room  cried
silence  to your seats
discipline prevailed  in five minutes the confused throng wasresolved into order  and comparative silence quelled the babel clamourof tongues  the upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts  butstill  all seemed to wait  ranged on benches down the sides of theroom  the eighty girls sat motionless and erect  a quaint assemblagethey appeared  all with plain locks combed from their faces  not acurl visible  in brown dresses  made high and surrounded by a narrowtucker about the throat  with little pockets of holland (shapedsomething like a highlander s purse) tied in front of their frocks and destined to serve the purpose of a work bag  all  too  wearingwoollen stockings and country made shoes  fastened with brass buckles above twenty of those clad in this costume were full grown girls  orrather young women  it suited them ill  and gave an air of oddity evento the prettiest
i was still looking at them  and also at intervals examining theteachers  none of whom precisely pleased me  for the stout one was alittle coarse  the dark one not a little fierce  the foreigner harshand grotesque  and miss miller  poor thing  looked purple weather beaten  and over worked  when  as my eye wandered from face toface  the whole school rose simultaneously  as if moved by a commonspring
what was the matter  i had heard no order given  i was puzzled  erei had gathered my wits  the classes were again seated  but as all eyeswere now turned to one point  mine followed the general direction  andencountered the personage who had received me last night  she stood atthe bottom of the long room  on the hearth  for there was a fire ateach end  she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely miss miller  approaching  seemed to ask her a question  and havingreceived her answer  went back to her place  and said aloud
monitor of the first class  fetch the globes
while the direction was being executed  the lady consulted movedslowly up the room  i suppose i have a considerable organ ofveneration  for i retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which myeyes traced her steps  seen now  in broad day light  she lookedtall  fair  and shapely  brown eyes with a benignant light in theiririds  and a fine pencilling of long lashes round  relieved thewhiteness of her large front  on each of her temples her hair  of avery dark brown  was clustered in round curls  according to thefashion of those times  when neither smooth bands nor long ringletswere in vogue  her dress  also in the mode of the day  was of purplecloth  relieved by a sort of spanish trimming of black velvet  agold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at hergirdle  let the reader add  to complete the picture  refined features a complexion  if pale  clear  and a stately air and carriage  and hewill have  at least  as clearly as words can give it  a correct ideaof the exterior of miss temple  maria temple  as i afterwards sawthe name written in a prayer book intrusted to me to carry to church
the superintendent of lowood (for such was this lady) havingtaken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables summoned the first class round her  and commenced giving a lesson ongeography  the lower classes were called by the teachers repetitions in history  grammar  etc   went on for an hour  writingand arithmetic succeeded  and music lessons were given by misstemple to some of the elder girls  the duration of each lesson wasmeasured by the clock  which at last struck twelve  the superintendentrose
i have a word to address to the pupils   said she
the tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth but it sank at her voice  she went on
you had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat  you mustbe hungry   i have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall beserved to all
the teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise
it is to be done on my responsibility   she added  in anexplanatory tone to them  and immediately afterwards left the room
the bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed  tothe high delight and refreshment of the whole school  the order wasnow given  to the garden   each put on a coarse straw bonnet  withstrings of coloured calico  and a cloak of grey frieze  i wassimilarly equipped  and  following the stream  i made my way intothe open air
the garden was a wide enclosure  surrounded with walls so high asto exclude every glimpse of prospect  a covered verandah ran downone side  and broad walks bordered a middle space divided intoscores of little beds  these beds were assigned as gardens for thepupils to cultivate  and each bed had an owner  when full of flowersthey would doubtless look pretty  but now  at the latter end ofjanuary  all was wintry blight and brown decay  i shuddered as i stoodand looked round me  it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise  notpositively rainy  but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog  all underfoot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday  thestronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games  butsundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth inthe verandah  and amongst these  as the dense mist penetrated to theirshivering frames  i heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough
as yet i had spoken to no one  nor did anybody seem to takenotice of me  i stood lonely enough  but to that feeling ofisolation i was accustomed  it did not oppress me much  i leantagainst a pillar of the verandah  drew my grey mantle close aboutme  and  trying to forget the cold which nipped me without  and theunsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within  delivered myself up tothe employment of watching and thinking  my reflections were tooundefined and fragmentary to merit record  i hardly yet knew where iwas  gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurabledistance  the present was vague and strange  and of the future i couldform no conjecture  i looked round the convent like garden  and thenup at the house  a large building  half of which seemed grey andold  the other half quite new  the new part  containing the schoolroomand dormitory  was lit by mullioned and latticed windows  which gaveit a church like aspect  a stone tablet over the door bore thisinscription brocklehurst  of brocklehurst hall  in this county    let your lightso shine before men  that they may see your good works  and glorifyyour father which is in heaven    st  matt  v  16
i read these words over and over again  i felt that anexplanation belonged to them  and was unable fully to penetratetheir import  i was still pondering the signification of institution   and endeavouring to make out a connection between thefirst words and the verse of scripture  when the sound of a coughclose behind me made me turn my head  i saw a girl sitting on astone bench near  she was bent over a book  on the perusal of whichshe seemed intent  from where i stood i could see the title  it wasrasselas  a name that struck me as strange  and consequentlyattractive  in turning a leaf she happened to look up  and i said toher directly
is your book interesting   i had already formed the intention ofasking her to lend it to me some day
i like it   she answered  after a pause of a second or two  duringwhich she examined me
what is it about   i continued  i hardly know where i found thehardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger  the step wascontrary to my nature and habits  but i think her occupation touched achord of sympathy somewhere  for i too liked reading  though of afrivolous and childish kind  i could not digest or comprehend theserious or substantial
you may look at it   replied the girl  offering me the book
i did so  a brief examination convinced me that the contents wereless taking than the title  rasselas looked dull to my trifling taste i saw nothing about fairies  nothing about genii  no bright varietyseemed spread over the closely printed pages  i returned it to her she received it quietly  and without saying anything she was aboutto relapse into her former studious mood  again i ventured todisturb her
can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the doormeans  what is lowood institution
this house where you are come to live
and why do they call it institution  is it in any way differentfrom other schools
it is partly a charity school  you and i  and all the rest ofus  are charity children  i suppose you are an orphan  are noteither your father or your mother dead
both died before i can remember
well  all the girls here have lost either one or both parents  andthis is called an institution for educating orphans
do we pay no money  do they keep us for nothing
we pay  or our friends pay  fifteen pounds a year for each
then why do they call us charity children
because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching  andthe deficiency is supplied by subscription
who subscribes
different benevolent minded ladies and gentlemen in thisneighbourhood and in london
who was naomi brocklehurst
the lady who built the new part of this house as that tabletrecords  and whose son overlooks and directs everything here
why
because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment
then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears awatch  and who said we were to have some bread and cheese
to miss temple  oh  no  i wish it did  she has to answer to mr brocklehurst for all she does  mr  brocklehurst buys all our foodand all our clothes
does he live here
no  two miles off  at a large hall
is he a good man
he is a clergyman  and is said to do a great deal of good
did you say that tall lady was called miss temple
yes
and what are the other teachers called
the one with red cheeks is called miss smith  she attends to thework  and cuts out  for we make our own clothes  our frocks  andpelisses  and everything  the little one with black hair is missscatcherd  she teaches history and grammar  and hears the second classrepetitions  and the one who wears a shawl  and has apocket handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband  ismadame pierrot  she comes from lisle  in france  and teaches french
do you like the teachers
well enough
do you like the little black one  and the madame    i cannotpronounce her name as you do
miss scatcherd is hasty  you must take care not to offend her madame pierrot is not a bad sort of person
but miss temple is the best  isn t she
miss temple is very good and very clever  she is above the rest because she knows far more than they do
have you been long here
two years
are you an orphan
my mother is dead
are you happy here
you ask rather too many questions  i have given you answers enoughfor the present  now i want to read
but at that moment the summons sounded for dinner  all re enteredthe house  the odour which now filled the refectory was scarcelymore appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast the dinner was served in two huge tin plated vessels  whence rose astrong steam redolent of rancid fat  i found the mess to consist ofindifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat  mixed andcooked together  of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful wasapportioned to each pupil  i ate what i could  and wondered withinmyself whether every day s fare would be like this
after dinner  we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom  lessonsrecommenced  and were continued till five o clock
the only marked event of the afternoon was  that i saw the girlwith whom i had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace bymiss scatcherd from a history class  and sent to stand in the middleof the large schoolroom  the punishment seemed to me in a highdegree ignominious  especially for so great a girl  she lookedthirteen or upwards  i expected she would show signs of great distressand shame  but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed composed  though grave  she stood  the central mark of all eyes  how can she bear it so quietly  so firmly   i asked of myself  were i in her place  it seems to me i should wish the earth to openand swallow me up  she looks as if she were thinking of somethingbeyond her punishment  beyond her situation  of something not roundher nor before her  i have heard of day dreams  is she in aday dream now  her eyes are fixed on the floor  but i am sure theydo not see it  her sight seems turned in  gone down into her heart she is looking at what she can remember  i believe  not at what isreally present  i wonder what sort of a girl she is  whether good ornaughty
soon after five p m  we had another meal  consisting of a small mugof coffee  and half a slice of brown bread  i devoured my bread anddrank my coffee with relish  but i should have been glad of as muchmore  i was still hungry  half an hour s recreation succeeded  thenstudy  then the glass of water and the piece of oat cake  prayers  andbed  such was my first day at lowood
chapter vi
the next day commenced as before  getting up and dressing byrushlight  but this morning we were obliged to dispense with theceremony of washing  the water in the pitchers was frozen  a changehad taken place in the weather the preceding evening  and a keennorth east wind  whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windowsall night long  had made us shiver in our beds  and turned thecontents of the ewers to ice
before the long hour and a half of prayers and bible reading wasover  i felt ready to perish with cold  breakfast time came at last and this morning the porridge was not burnt  the quality waseatable  the quantity small  how small my portion seemed  i wishedit had been doubled
in the course of the day i was enrolled a member of the fourthclass  and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me  hitherto  ihad only been a spectator of the proceedings at lowood  i was now tobecome an actor therein  at first  being little accustomed to learn byheart  the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult  thefrequent change from task to task  too  bewildered me  and i wasglad when  about three o clock in the afternoon  miss smith put intomy hands a border of muslin two yards long  together with needle thimble  etc   and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom with directions to hem the same  at that hour most of the otherswere sewing likewise  but one class still stood round miss scatcherd schair reading  and as all was quiet  the subject of their lessonscould be heard  together with the manner in which each girlacquitted herself  and the animadversions or commendations of missscatcherd on the performance  it was english history  among thereaders i observed my acquaintance of the verandah  at thecommencement of the lesson  her place had been at the top of theclass  but for some error of pronunciation  or some inattention tostops  she was suddenly sent to the very bottom  even in thatobscure position  miss scatcherd continued to make her an object ofconstant notice  she was continually addressing to her such phrases asthe following
burns  (such it seems was her name  the girls here were all calledby their surnames  as boys are elsewhere)   burns  you are standing onthe side of your shoe  turn your toes out immediately    burns  youpoke your chin most unpleasantly  draw it in    burns  i insist onyour holding your head up  i will not have you before me in thatattitude   etc  etc
a chapter having been read through twice  the books were closed andthe girls examined  the lesson had comprised part of the reign ofcharles i  and there were sundry questions about tonnage andpoundage and ship money  which most of them appeared unable to answer still  every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reachedburns  her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the wholelesson  and she was ready with answers on every point  i keptexpecting that miss scatcherd would praise her attention  but  insteadof that  she suddenly cried out
you dirty  disagreeable girl  you have never cleaned your nailsthis morning
burns made no answer  i wondered at her silence
why   thought i   does she not explain that she could neitherclean her nails nor wash her face  as the water was frozen
my attention was now called off by miss smith desiring me to hold askein of thread  while she was winding it  she talked to me fromtime to time  asking whether i had ever been at school before  whetheri could mark  stitch  knit  etc   till she dismissed me  i could notpursue my observations on miss scatcherd s movements  when ireturned to my seat  that lady was just delivering an order of which idid not catch the import  but burns immediately left the class  andgoing into the small inner room where the books were kept  returned inhalf a minute  carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together atone end  this ominous tool she presented to miss scatcherd with arespectful curtsey  then she quietly  and without being told  unloosedher pinafore  and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on herneck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs  not a tear rose toburns s eye  and  while i paused from my sewing  because my fingersquivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotentanger  not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinaryexpression
hardened girl   exclaimed miss scatcherd   nothing can correct youof your slatternly habits  carry the rod away
burns obeyed  i looked at her narrowly as she emerged from thebook closet  she was just putting back her handkerchief into herpocket  and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek
the play hour in the evening i thought the pleasantest fractionof the day at lowood  the bit of bread  the draught of coffeeswallowed at five o clock had revived vitality  if it had notsatisfied hunger  the long restraint of the day was slackened  theschoolroom felt warmer than in the morning  its fires being allowed toburn a little more brightly  to supply  in some measure  the placeof candles  not yet introduced  the ruddy gloaming  the licenseduproar  the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense ofliberty
on the evening of the day on which i had seen miss scatcherd flogher pupil  burns  i wandered as usual among the forms and tables andlaughing groups without a companion  yet not feeling lonely  when ipassed the windows  i now and then lifted a blind  and looked out it snowed fast  a drift was already forming against the lower panes putting my ear close to the window  i could distinguish from thegleeful tumult within  the disconsolate moan of the wind outside
probably  if i had lately left a good home and kind parents  thiswould have been the hour when i should most keenly have regrettedthe separation  that wind would then have saddened my heart  thisobscure chaos would have disturbed my peace  as it was  i derived fromboth a strange excitement  and reckless and feverish  i wished thewind to howl more wildly  the gloom to deepen to darkness  and theconfusion to rise to clamour
jumping over forms  and creeping under tables  i made my way to oneof the fire places  there  kneeling by the high wire fender  i foundburns  absorbed  silent  abstracted from all round her by thecompanionship of a book  which she read by the dim glare of theembers
is it still rasselas   i asked  coming behind her
yes   she said   and i have just finished it
and in five minutes more she shut it up  i was glad of this
now   thought i   i can perhaps get her to talk   i sat down byher on the floor
what is your name besides burns
helen
do you come a long way from here
i come from a place farther north  quite on the borders ofscotland
will you ever go back
i hope so  but nobody can be sure of the future
you must wish to leave lowood
no  why should i  i was sent to lowood to get an education  and itwould be of no use going away until i have attained that object
but that teacher  miss scatcherd  is so cruel to you
cruel  not at all  she is severe  she dislikes my faults
and if i were in your place i should dislike her  i shouldresist her  if she struck me with that rod  i should get it from herhand  i should break it under her nose
probably you would do nothing of the sort  but if you did  mr brocklehurst would expel you from the school  that would be a greatgrief to your relations  it is far better to endure patiently asmart which nobody feels but yourself  than to commit a hasty actionwhose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you  andbesides  the bible bids us return good for evil
but then it seems disgraceful to be flogged  and to be sent tostand in the middle of a room full of people  and you are such a greatgirl  i am far younger than you  and i could not bear it
yet it would be your duty to bear it  if you could not avoid it it is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to berequired to bear
i heard her with wonder  i could not comprehend this doctrine ofendurance  and still less could i understand or sympathise with theforbearance she expressed for her chastiser  still i felt that helenburns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes  i suspectedshe might be right and i wrong  but i would not ponder the matterdeeply  like felix  i put it off to a more convenient season
you say you have faults  helen  what are they  to me you seem verygood
then learn from me  not to judge by appearances  i am  as missscatcherd said  slatternly  i seldom put  and never keep  things inorder  i am careless  i forget rules  i read when i should learn mylessons  i have no method  and sometimes i say  like you  i cannotbear to be subjected to systematic arrangements  this is all veryprovoking to miss scatcherd  who is naturally neat  punctual  andparticular
and cross and cruel   i added  but helen burns would not admitmy addition  she kept silence
is miss temple as severe to you as miss scatcherd
at the utterance of miss temple s name  a soft smile flitted overher grave face
miss temple is full of goodness  it pains her to be severe toany one  even the worst in the school  she sees my errors  and tellsme of them gently  and if i do anything worthy of praise  she gives memy meed liberally  one strong proof of my wretchedly defectivenature is  that even her expostulations  so mild  so rational  have noinfluence to cure me of my faults  and even her praise  though i valueit most highly  cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight
that is curious   said i   it is so easy to be careful
for you i have no doubt it is  i observed you in your class thismorning  and saw you were closely attentive  your thoughts neverseemed to wander while miss miller explained the lesson and questionedyou  now  mine continually rove away  when i should be listening tomiss scatcherd  and collecting all she says with assiduity  often ilose the very sound of her voice  i fall into a sort of dream sometimes i think i am in northumberland  and that the noises i hearround me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs throughdeepden  near our house   then  when it comes to my turn to reply  ihave to be awakened  and having heard nothing of what was read forlistening to the visionary brook  i have no answer ready
yet how well you replied this afternoon
it was mere chance  the subject on which we had been reading hadinterested me  this afternoon  instead of dreaming of deepden  i waswondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly andunwisely as charles the first sometimes did  and i thought what a pityit was that  with his integrity and conscientiousness  he could see nofarther than the prerogatives of the crown  if he had but been able tolook to a distance  and see how what they call the spirit of the agewas tending  still  i like charles  i respect him  i pity him  poormurdered king  yes  his enemies were the worst  they shed blood theyhad no right to shed  how dared they kill him
helen was talking to herself now  she had forgotten i could notvery well understand her  that i was ignorant  or nearly so  of thesubject she discussed  i recalled her to my level
and when miss temple teaches you  do your thoughts wander then
no  certainly  not often  because miss temple has generallysomething to say which is newer than my own reflections  herlanguage is singularly agreeable to me  and the information shecommunicates is often just what i wished to gain
well  then  with miss temple you are good
yes  in a passive way  i make no effort  i follow as inclinationguides me  there is no merit in such goodness
a great deal  you are good to those who are good to you  it is alli ever desire to be  if people were always kind and obedient tothose who are cruel and unjust  the wicked people would have it alltheir own way  they would never feel afraid  and so they would neveralter  but would grow worse and worse  when we are struck at without areason  we should strike back again very hard  i am sure we should  sohard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again
you will change your mind  i hope  when you grow older  as yet youare but a little untaught girl
but i feel this  helen  i must dislike those who  whatever i do toplease them  persist in disliking me  i must resist those who punishme unjustly  it is as natural as that i should love those who showme affection  or submit to punishment when i feel it is deserved
heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine  but christiansand civilised nations disown it
how  i don t understand
it is not violence that best overcomes hate  nor vengeance thatmost certainly heals injury
what then
read the new testament  and observe what christ says  and how heacts  make his word your rule  and his conduct your example
what does he say
love your enemies  bless them that curse you  do good to them thathate you and despitefully use you
then i should love mrs  reed  which i cannot do  i should blessher son john  which is impossible
in her turn  helen burns asked me to explain  and i proceededforthwith to pour out  in my own way  the tale of my sufferings andresentments  bitter and truculent when excited  i spoke as i felt without reserve or softening
helen heard me patiently to the end  i expected she would then makea remark  but she said nothing
well   i asked impatiently   is not mrs  reed a hard hearted bad woman
she has been unkind to you  no doubt  because you see  shedislikes your cast of character  as miss scatcherd does mine  buthow minutely you remember all she has done and said to you  what asingularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on yourheart  no ill usage so brands its record on my feelings  would you notbe happier if you tried to forget her severity  together with thepassionate emotions it excited  life appears to me too short to bespent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs  we are  and must be one and all  burdened with faults in this world  but the time willsoon come when  i trust  we shall put them off in putting off ourcorruptible bodies  when debasement and sin will fall from us withthis cumbrous frame of flesh  and only the spark of the spirit willremain   the impalpable principle of light and thought  pure as whenit left the creator to inspire the creature  whence it came it willreturn  perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher thanman  perhaps to pass through gradations of glory  from the palehuman soul to brighten to the seraph  surely it will never  on thecontrary  be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend  no  i cannotbelieve that  i hold another creed  which no one ever taught me  andwhich i seldom mention  but in which i delight  and to which icling  for it extends hope to all  it makes eternity a rest  amighty home  not a terror and an abyss  besides  with this creed  ican so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime  i canso sincerely forgive the first while i abhor the last  with this creedrevenge never worries my heart  degradation never too deeplydisgusts me  injustice never crushes me too low  i live in calm looking to the end
helen s head  always drooping  sank a little lower as shefinished this sentence  i saw by her look she wished no longer to talkto me  but rather to converse with her own thoughts  she was notallowed much time for meditation  a monitor  a great rough girl presently came up  exclaiming in a strong cumberland accent
helen burns  if you don t go and put your drawer in order  andfold up your work this minute  i ll tell miss scatcherd to come andlook at it
helen sighed as her reverie fled  and getting up  obeyed themonitor without reply as without delay
chapter vii
my first quarter at lowood seemed an age  and not the golden ageeither  it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties inhabituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks  the fear offailure in these points harassed me worse than the physicalhardships of my lot  though these were no trifles
during january  february  and part of march  the deep snows  and after their melting  the almost impassable roads  prevented ourstirring beyond the garden walls  except to go to church  but withinthese limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air  ourclothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold  we hadno boots  the snow got into our shoes and melted there  our unglovedhands became numbed and covered with chilblains  as were our feet  iremember well the distracting irritation i endured from this causeevery evening  when my feet inflamed  and the torture of thrusting theswelled  raw  and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning  then thescanty supply of food was distressing  with the keen appetites ofgrowing children  we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive adelicate invalid  from this deficiency of nourishment resulted anabuse  which pressed hardly on the younger pupils  whenever thefamished great girls had an opportunity  they would coax or menace thelittle ones out of their portion  many a time i have shared betweentwo claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed atteatime  and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of mymug of coffee  i have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment ofsecret tears  forced from me by the exigency of hunger
sundays were dreary days in that wintry season  we had to walktwo miles to brocklebridge church  where our patron officiated  we setout cold  we arrived at church colder  during the morning service webecame almost paralysed  it was too far to return to dinner  and anallowance of cold meat and bread  in the same penurious proportionobserved in our ordinary meals  was served round between the services
at the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed andhilly road  where the bitter winter wind  blowing over a range ofsnowy summits to the north  almost flayed the skin from our faces
i can remember miss temple walking lightly and rapidly along ourdrooping line  her plaid cloak  which the frosty wind fluttered gathered close about her  and encouraging us  by precept andexample  to keep up our spirits  and march forward  as she said   likestalwart soldiers   the other teachers  poor things  were generallythemselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others
how we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when wegot back  but  to the little ones at least  this was denied  eachhearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row ofgreat girls  and behind them the younger children crouched ingroups  wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores
a little solace came at tea time  in the shape of a double rationof bread  a whole  instead of a half  slice  with the deliciousaddition of a thin scrape of butter  it was the hebdomadal treat towhich we all looked forward from sabbath to sabbath  i generallycontrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself  butthe remainder i was invariably obliged to part with
the sunday evening was spent in repeating  by heart  the churchcatechism  and the fifth  sixth  and seventh chapters of st matthew  and in listening to a long sermon  read by miss miller  whoseirrepressible yawns attested her weariness  a frequent interlude ofthese performances was the enactment of the part of eutychus by somehalf dozen of little girls  who  overpowered with sleep  would falldown  if not out of the third loft  yet off the fourth form  and betaken up half dead  the remedy was  to thrust them forward into thecentre of the schoolroom  and oblige them to stand there till thesermon was finished  sometimes their feet failed them  and they sanktogether in a heap  they were then propped up with the monitors high stools
i have not yet alluded to the visits of mr  brocklehurst  andindeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of thefirst month after my arrival  perhaps prolonging his stay with hisfriend the archdeacon  his absence was a relief to me  i need notsay that i had my own reasons for dreading his coming  but come he didat last
one afternoon (i had then been three weeks at lowood)  as i wassitting with a slate in my hand  puzzling over a sum in long division my eyes  raised in abstraction to the window  caught sight of a figurejust passing  i recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline and when  two minutes after  all the school  teachers included  roseen masse  it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertainwhose entrance they thus greeted  a long stride measured theschoolroom  and presently beside miss temple  who herself had risen stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominouslyfrom the hearthrug of gateshead  i now glanced sideways at thispiece of architecture  yes  i was right  it was mr  brocklehurst buttoned up in a surtout  and looking longer  narrower  and more rigidthan ever
i had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition  toowell i remembered the perfidious hints given by mrs  reed about mydisposition  etc   the promise pledged by mr  brocklehurst toapprise miss temple and the teachers of my vicious nature  all along ihad been dreading the fulfilment of this promise   i had beenlooking out daily for the  coming man   whose information respectingmy past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever now there he was
he stood at miss temple s side  he was speaking low in her ear  idid not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy  and iwatched her eye with painful anxiety  expecting every moment to seeits dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt  ilistened too  and as i happened to be seated quite at the top of theroom  i caught most of what he said  its import relieved me fromimmediate apprehension
i suppose  miss temple  the thread i bought at lowton will do it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calicochemises  and i sorted the needles to match  you may tell miss smiththat i forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles  but sheshall have some papers sent in next week  and she is not  on anyaccount  to give out more than one at a time to each pupil  if theyhave more  they are apt to be careless and lose them  and  o ma am i wish the woollen stockings were better looked to   when i was herelast  i went into the kitchen garden and examined the clothes dryingon the line  there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state ofrepair  from the size of the holes in them i was sure they had notbeen well mended from time to time
he paused
your directions shall be attended to  sir   said miss temple
and  ma am   he continued   the laundress tells me some of thegirls have two clean tuckers in the week  it is too much  the ruleslimit them to one
i think i can explain that circumstance  sir  agnes andcatherine johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends atlowton last thursday  and i gave them leave to put on clean tuckersfor the occasion
mr  brocklehurst nodded
well  for once it may pass  but please not to let the circumstanceoccur too often  and there is another thing which surprised me  ifind  in settling accounts with the housekeeper  that a lunch consisting of bread and cheese  has twice been served out to the girlsduring the past fortnight  how is this  i looked over the regulations and i find no such meal as lunch mentioned  who introduced thisinnovation  and by what authority
i must be responsible for the circumstance  sir   replied misstemple   the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could notpossibly eat it  and i dared not allow them to remain fasting tilldinner time
madam  allow me an instant  you are aware that my plan in bringingup these girls is  not to accustom them to habits of luxury andindulgence  but to render them hardy  patient  self denying  shouldany little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur  such asthe spoiling of a meal  the under or the over dressing of a dish the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with somethingmore delicate the comfort lost  thus pampering the body andobviating the aim of this institution  it ought to be improved tothe spiritual edification of the pupils  by encouraging them to evincefortitude under the temporary privation  a brief address on thoseoccasions would not be mistimed  wherein a judicious instructorwould take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of theprimitive christians  to the torments of martyrs  to theexhortations of our blessed lord himself  calling upon his disciplesto take up their cross and follow him  to his warnings that manshall not live by bread alone  but by every word that proceedeth outof the mouth of god  to his divine consolations  "if ye sufferhunger or thirst for my sake  happy are ye " oh  madam  when you putbread and cheese  instead of burnt porridge  into these children smouths  you may indeed feed their vile bodies  but you little thinkhow you starve their immortal souls
mr  brocklehurst again paused  perhaps overcome by his feelings miss temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her  butshe now gazed straight before her  and her face  naturally pale asmarble  appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of thatmaterial  especially her mouth  closed as if it would have requireda sculptor s chisel to open it  and her brow settled gradually intopetrified severity
meantime  mr  brocklehurst  standing on the hearth with his handsbehind his back  majestically surveyed the whole school  suddenlyhis eye gave a blink  as if it had met something that either dazzledor shocked its pupil  turning  he said in more rapid accents than hehad hitherto used
miss temple  miss temple  what  what is that girl with curledhair  red hair  ma am  curled  curled all over   and extending hiscane he pointed to the awful object  his hand shaking as he did so
it is julia severn   replied miss temple  very quietly
julia severn  ma am  and why has she  or any other  curled hair why  in defiance of every precept and principle of this house  doesshe conform to the world so openly  here in an evangelical  charitableestablishment  as to wear her hair one mass of curls
julia s hair curls naturally   returned miss temple  still morequietly
naturally  yes  but we are not to conform to nature  i wishthese girls to be the children of grace  and why that abundance  ihave again and again intimated that i desire the hair to be arrangedclosely  modestly  plainly  miss temple  that girl s hair must becut off entirely  i will send a barber tomorrow  and i see otherswho have far too much of the excrescence  that tall girl  tell herto turn round  tell all the first form to rise up and direct theirfaces to the wall
miss temple passed her handkerchief over her lips  as if tosmooth away the involuntary smile that curled them  she gave theorder  however  and when the first class could take in what wasrequired of them  they obeyed  leaning a little back on my bench  icould see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on thismanoeuvre  it was a pity mr  brocklehurst could not see them too  hewould perhaps have felt that  whatever he might do with the outside ofthe cup and platter  the inside was further beyond his interferencethan he imagined
he scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some fiveminutes  then pronounced sentence  these words fell like the knellof doom
all those top knots must be cut off
miss temple seemed to remonstrate
madam   he pursued   i have a master to serve whose kingdom is notof this world  my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts ofthe flesh  to teach them to clothe themselves with shame facedness andsobriety  not with braided hair and costly apparel  and each of theyoung persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits whichvanity itself might have woven  these  i repeat  must be cut off think of the time wasted  of
mr  brocklehurst was here interrupted  three other visitors ladies  now entered the room  they ought to have come a littlesooner to have heard his lecture on dress  for they were splendidlyattired in velvet  silk  and furs  the two younger of the trio (finegirls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats  then in fashion shaded with ostrich plumes  and from under the brim of this gracefulhead dress fell a profusion of light tresses  elaborately curled the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl  trimmed withermine  and she wore a false front of french curls
these ladies were deferentially received by miss temple  as mrs and the misses brocklehurst  and conducted to seats of honour at thetop of the room  it seems they had come in the carriage with theirreverend relative  and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of theroom upstairs  while he transacted business with the housekeeper questioned the laundress  and lectured the superintendent  they nowproceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to miss smith  whowas charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of thedormitories  but i had no time to listen to what they said  othermatters called off and enchained my attention
hitherto  while gathering up the discourse of mr  brocklehurstand miss temple  i had not  at the same time  neglected precautions tosecure my personal safety  which i thought would be effected  if icould only elude observation  to this end  i had sat well back onthe form  and while seeming to be busy with my sum  had held myslate in such a manner as to conceal my face  i might have escapednotice  had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip frommy hand  and falling with an obtrusive crash  directly drawn every eyeupon me  i knew it was all over now  and  as i stooped to pick upthe two fragments of slate  i rallied my forces for the worst  itcame
a careless girl   said mr  brocklehurst  and immediately after  it is the new pupil  i perceive   and before i could draw breath  i must not forget i have a word to say respecting her   then aloud how loud it seemed to me   let the child who broke her slate comeforward
of my own accord i could not have stirred  i was paralysed  but thetwo great girls who sat on each side of me  set me on my legs andpushed me towards the dread judge  and then miss temple gentlyassisted me to his very feet  and i caught her whispered counsel
don t be afraid  jane  i saw it was an accident  you shall notbe punished
the kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger
another minute  and she will despise me for a hypocrite  thought i  and an impulse of fury against reed  brocklehurst  andco  bounded in my pulses at the conviction  i was no helen burns
fetch that stool   said mr  brocklehurst  pointing to a veryhigh one from which a monitor had just risen  it was brought
place the child upon it
and i was placed there  by whom i don t know  i was in no conditionto note particulars  i was only aware that they had hoisted me up tothe height of mr  brocklehurst s nose  that he was within a yard ofme  and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and acloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me
mr  brocklehurst hemmed
ladies   said he  turning to his family   miss temple  teachers and children  you all see this girl
of course they did  for i felt their eyes directed likeburning glasses against my scorched skin
you see she is yet young  you observe she possesses the ordinaryform of childhood  god has graciously given her the shape that hehas given to all of us  no signal deformity points her out as a markedcharacter  who would think that the evil one had already found aservant and agent in her  yet such  i grieve to say  is the case
a pause  in which i began to steady the palsy of my nerves  andto feel that the rubicon was passed  and that the trial  no longerto be shirked  must be firmly sustained
my dear children   pursued the black marble clergyman  withpathos   this is a sad  a melancholy occasion  for it becomes myduty to warn you  that this girl  who might be one of god s own lambs is a little castaway  not a member of the true flock  but evidently aninterloper and an alien  you must be on your guard against her  youmust shun her example  if necessary  avoid her company  exclude herfrom your sports  and shut her out from your converse  teachers  youmust watch her  keep your eyes on her movements  weigh well her words scrutinise her actions  punish her body to save her soul  if indeed  such salvation be possible  for (my tongue falters while itell it) this girl  this child  the native of a christian land worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to brahma andkneels before juggernaut  this girl is  a liar
now came a pause of ten minutes  during which i  by this time inperfect possession of my wits  observed all the female brocklehurstsproduce their pocket handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro  and the twoyounger ones whispered   how shocking
mr  brocklehurst resumed
this i learned from her benefactress  from the pious andcharitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state  reared her as herown daughter  and whose kindness  whose generosity the unhappy girlrepaid by an ingratitude so bad  so dreadful  that at last herexcellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own youngones  fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate theirpurity  she has sent her here to be healed  even as the jews of oldsent their diseased to the troubled pool of bethesda  and  teachers superintendent  i beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate roundher
with this sublime conclusion  mr  brocklehurst adjusted the topbutton of his surtout  muttered something to his family  who rose bowed to miss temple  and then all the great people sailed in statefrom the room  turning at the door  my judge said
let her stand half an hour longer on that stool  and let no onespeak to her during the remainder of the day
there was i  then  mounted aloft  i  who had said i could notbear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of theroom  was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy  what mysensations were  no language can describe  but just as they allrose  stifling my breath and constricting my throat  a girl came upand passed me  in passing  she lifted her eyes  what a strange lightinspired them  what an extraordinary sensation that ray sent throughme  how the new feeling bore me up  it was as if a martyr  a hero  hadpassed a slave or victim  and imparted strength in the transit  imastered the rising hysteria  lifted up my head  and took a firm standon the stool  helen burns asked some slight questions about her workof miss smith  was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry  returnedto her place  and smiled at me as she again went by  what a smile  iremember it now  and i know that it was the effluence of fineintellect  of true courage  it lit up her marked lineaments  herthin face  her sunken grey eye  like a reflection from the aspect ofan angel  yet at that moment helen burns wore on her arm  the untidybadge   scarcely an hour ago i had heard her condemned by missscatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she hadblotted an exercise in copying it out  such is the imperfect nature ofman  such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet  and eyeslike miss scatcherd s can only see those minute defects  and are blindto the full brightness of the orb

ere the half hour ended  five o clock struck  school was dismissed and all were gone into the refectory to tea  i now ventured todescend  it was deep dusk  i retired into a corner and sat down on thefloor  the spell by which i had been so far supported began todissolve  reaction took place  and soon  so overwhelming was the griefthat seized me  i sank prostrate with my face to the ground  now iwept  helen burns was not here  nothing sustained me  left to myself iabandoned myself  and my tears watered the boards  i had meant to beso good  and to do so much at lowood  to make so many friends  to earnrespect and win affection  already i had made visible progress  thatvery morning i had reached the head of my class  miss miller hadpraised me warmly  miss temple had smiled approbation  she hadpromised to teach me drawing  and to let me learn french  if icontinued to make similar improvement two months longer  and then iwas well received by my fellow pupils  treated as an equal by those ofmy own age  and not molested by any  now  here i lay again crushed andtrodden on  and could i ever rise more
never   i thought  and ardently i wished to die  while sobbing outthis wish in broken accents  some one approached  i started up again helen burns was near me  the fading fires just showed her comingup the long  vacant room  she brought my coffee and bread
come  eat something   she said  but i put both away from me feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my presentcondition  helen regarded me  probably with surprise  i could notnow abate my agitation  though i tried hard  i continued to weepaloud  she sat down on the ground near me  embraced her knees with herarms  and rested her head upon them  in that attitude she remainedsilent as an indian  i was the first who spoke
helen  why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be aliar
everybody  jane  why  there are only eighty people who haveheard you called so  and the world contains hundreds of millions
but what have i to do with millions  the eighty  i know  despiseme
jane  you are mistaken  probably not one in the school eitherdespises or dislikes you  many  i am sure  pity you much
how can they pity me after what mr  brocklehurst has said
mr  brocklehurst is not a god  nor is he even a great andadmired man  he is little liked here  he never took steps to makehimself liked  had he treated you as an especial favourite  youwould have found enemies  declared or covert  all around you  as itis  the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two  butfriendly feelings are concealed in their hearts  and if youpersevere in doing well  these feelings will ere long appear so muchthe more evidently for their temporary suppression  besides  jane  she paused
well  helen   said i  putting my hand into hers  she chafed myfingers gently to warm them  and went on
if all the world hated you  and believed you wicked  while yourown conscience approved you  and absolved you from guilt  you wouldnot be without friends
no  i know i should think well of myself  but that is notenough  if others don t love me i would rather die than live  i cannotbear to be solitary and hated  helen  look here  to gain some realaffection from you  or miss temple  or any other whom i truly love i would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken  or tolet a bull toss me  or to stand behind a kicking horse  and let itdash its hoof at my chest
hush  jane  you think too much of the love of human beings  youare too impulsive  too vehement  the sovereign hand that createdyour frame  and put life into it  has provided you with otherresources than your feeble self  or than creatures feeble as you besides this earth  and besides the race of men  there is an invisibleworld and a kingdom of spirits  that world is round us  for it iseverywhere  and those spirits watch us  for they are commissioned toguard us  and if we were dying in pain and shame  if scorn smote us onall sides  and hatred crushed us  angels see our tortures  recogniseour innocence (if innocent we be  as i know you are of this chargewhich mr  brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at secondhandfrom mrs  reed  for i read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and onyour clear front)  and god waits only the separation of spirit fromflesh to crown us with a full reward  why  then  should we ever sinkoverwhelmed with distress  when life is so soon over  and death isso certain an entrance to happiness  to glory
i was silent  helen had calmed me  but in the tranquillity sheimparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness  i felt theimpression of woe as she spoke  but i could not tell whence it came and when  having done speaking  she breathed a little fast and cougheda short cough  i momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vagueconcern for her
resting my head on helen s shoulder  i put my arms round her waist she drew me to her  and we reposed in silence  we had not sat longthus  when another person came in  some heavy clouds  swept from thesky by a rising wind  had left the moon bare  and her light  streamingin through a window near  shone full both on us and on the approachingfigure  which we at once recognised as miss temple
i came on purpose to find you  jane eyre   said she   i want youin my room  and as helen burns is with you  she may come too
we went  following the superintendent s guidance  we had tothread some intricate passages  and mount a staircase before wereached her apartment  it contained a good fire  and lookedcheerful  miss temple told helen burns to be seated in a low arm chairon one side of the hearth  and herself taking another  she called meto her side
is it all over   she asked  looking down at my face   have youcried your grief away
i am afraid i never shall do that
why
because i have been wrongly accused  and you  ma am  and everybodyelse  will now think me wicked
we shall think you what you prove yourself to be  my child continue to act as a good girl  and you will satisfy us
shall i  miss temple
you will   said she  passing her arm round me   and now tell mewho is the lady whom mr  brocklehurst called your benefactress
mrs  reed  my uncle s wife  my uncle is dead  and he left me toher care
did she not  then  adopt you of her own accord
no  ma am  she was sorry to have to do it  but my uncle  as i haveoften heard the servants say  got her to promise before he died thatshe would always keep me
well now  jane  you know  or at least i will tell you  that when acriminal is accused  he is always allowed to speak in his own defence you have been charged with falsehood  defend yourself to me as well asyou can  say whatever your memory suggests as true  but add nothingand exaggerate nothing
i resolved  in the depth of my heart  that i would be mostmoderate  most correct  and  having reflected a few minutes in orderto arrange coherently what i had to say  i told her all the story ofmy sad childhood  exhausted by emotion  my language was more subduedthan it generally was when it developed that sad theme  and mindful ofhelen s warnings against the indulgence of resentment  i infusedinto the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary  thusrestrained and simplified  it sounded more credible  i felt as iwent on that miss temple fully believed me
in the course of the tale i had mentioned mr  lloyd as havingcome to see me after the fit  for i never forgot the  to me  frightfulepisode of the red room  in detailing which  my excitement was sure in some degree  to break bounds  for nothing could soften in myrecollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when mrs  reedspurned my wild supplication for pardon  and locked me a second timein the dark and haunted chamber
i had finished  miss temple regarded me a few minutes in silence she then said
i know something of mr  lloyd  i shall write to him  if hisreply agrees with your statement  you shall be publicly cleared fromevery imputation  to me  jane  you are clear now
she kissed me  and still keeping me at her side (where i was wellcontented to stand for i derived a child s pleasure from thecontemplation of her face  her dress  her one or two ornaments  herwhite forehead  her clustered and shining curls  and beaming darkeyes)  she proceeded to address helen burns
how are you to night  helen  have you coughed much to day
not quite so much  i think  ma am
and the pain in your chest
it is a little better
miss temple got up  took her hand and examined her pulse  thenshe returned to her own seat  as she resumed it  i heard her sigh low she was pensive a few minutes  then rousing herself  she saidcheerfully
but you two are my visitors to night  i must treat you as such  she rang her bell
barbara   she said to the servant who answered it   i have not yethad tea  bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies
and a tray was soon brought  how pretty  to my eyes  did thechina cups and bright teapot look  placed on the little round tablenear the fire  how fragrant was the steam of the beverage  and thescent of the toast  of which  however  i  to my dismay (for i wasbeginning to be hungry)  discerned only a very small portion  misstemple discerned it too
barbara   said she   can you not bring a little more bread andbutter  there is not enough for three
barbara went out  she returned soon
madam  mrs  harden says she has sent up the usual quantity
mrs  harden  be it observed  was the housekeeper  a woman after mr brocklehurst s own heart  made up of equal parts of whalebone andiron
oh  very well   returned miss temple   we must make it do barbara  i suppose   and as the girl withdrew she added  smiling  fortunately  i have it in my power to supply deficiencies for thisonce
having invited helen and me to approach the table  and placedbefore each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel oftoast  she got up  unlocked a drawer  and taking from it a parcelwrapped in paper  disclosed presently to our eyes a good sizedseed cake
i meant to give each of you some of this to take with you   saidshe   but as there is so little toast  you must have it now   andshe proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand
we feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia  and not theleast delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification withwhich our hostess regarded us  as we satisfied our famishedappetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied
tea over and the tray removed  she again summoned us to the fire we sat one on each side of her  and now a conversation followedbetween her and helen  which it was indeed a privilege to beadmitted to hear
miss temple had always something of serenity in her air  of statein her mien  of refined propriety in her language  which precludeddeviation into the ardent  the excited  the eager  something whichchastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her by a controlling sense of awe  and such was my feeling now  but asto helen burns  i was struck with wonder
the refreshing meal  the brilliant fire  the presence andkindness of her beloved instructress  or  perhaps  more than allthese  something in her own unique mind  had roused her powerswithin her  they woke  they kindled  first  they glowed in thebright tint of her cheek  which till this hour i had never seen butpale and bloodless  then they shone in the liquid lustre of hereyes  which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than thatof miss temple s  a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash nor pencilled brow  but of meaning  of movement  of radiance  then hersoul sat on her lips  and language flowed  from what source i cannottell  has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough  vigorous enough  tohold the swelling spring of pure  full  fervid eloquence  such was thecharacteristic of helen s discourse on that  to me  memorable evening her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as muchas many live during a protracted existence
they conversed of things i had never heard of  of nations and timespast  of countries far away  of secrets of nature discovered orguessed at  they spoke of books  how many they had read  what storesof knowledge they possessed  then they seemed so familiar withfrench names and french authors  but my amazement reached its climaxwhen miss temple asked helen if she sometimes snatched a moment torecall the latin her father had taught her  and taking a book from ashelf  bade her read and construe a page of virgil  and helenobeyed  my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line  shehad scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime  no delay couldbe admitted  miss temple embraced us both  saying  as she drew us toher heart
god bless you  my children
helen she held a little longer than me  she let her go morereluctantly  it was helen her eye followed to the door  it was for hershe a second time breathed a sad sigh  for her she wiped a tear fromher cheek
on reaching the bedroom  we heard the voice of miss scatcherd she was examining drawers  she had just pulled out helen burns s and when we entered helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand  and toldthat to morrow she should have half a dozen of untidily foldedarticles pinned to her shoulder
my things were indeed in shameful disorder   murmured helen to me in a low voice   i intended to have arranged them  but i forgot
next morning  miss scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on apiece of pasteboard the word  slattern   and bound it like aphylactery round helen s large  mild  intelligent  andbenign looking forehead  she wore it till evening  patient unresentful  regarding it as a deserved punishment  the moment missscatcherd withdrew after afternoon school  i ran to helen  tore itoff  and thrust it into the fire  the fury of which she wasincapable had been burning in my soul all day  and tears  hot andlarge  had continually been scalding my cheek  for the spectacle ofher sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart
about a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated  misstemple  who had written to mr  lloyd  received his answer  it appearedthat what he said went to corroborate my account  miss temple having assembled the whole school  announced that inquiry had beenmade into the charges alleged against jane eyre  and that she was mosthappy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from everyimputation  the teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me  and amurmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions
thus relieved of a grievous load  i from that hour set to workafresh  resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty  itoiled hard  and my success was proportionate to my efforts  mymemory  not naturally tenacious  improved with practice  exercisesharpened my wits  in a few weeks i was promoted to a higher class  inless than two months i was allowed to commence french and drawing  ilearned the first two tenses of the verb etre  and sketched my firstcottage (whose walls  by the bye  outrivalled in slope those of theleaning tower of pisa)  on the same day  that night  on going tobed  i forgot to prepare in imagination the barmecide supper of hotroast potatoes  or white bread and new milk  with which i was wontto amuse my inward cravings  i feasted instead on the spectacle ofideal drawings  which i saw in the dark  all the work of my own hands freely pencilled houses and trees  picturesque rocks and ruins cuyp like groups of cattle  sweet paintings of butterflies hoveringover unblown roses  of birds picking at ripe cherries  of wrens  nestsenclosing pearl like eggs  wreathed about with young ivy sprays  iexamined  too  in thought  the possibility of my ever being able totranslate currently a certain little french story which madame pierrothad that day shown me  nor was that problem solved to mysatisfaction ere i fell sweetly asleep
well has solomon said   better is a dinner of herbs where loveis  than a stalled ox and hatred therewith
i would not now have exchanged lowood with all its privations forgateshead and its daily luxuries
chapter ix
but the privations  or rather the hardships  of lowood lessened spring drew on  she was indeed already come  the frosts of winterhad ceased  its snows were melted  its cutting winds ameliorated  mywretched feet  flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air ofjanuary  began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings ofapril  the nights and mornings no longer by their canadian temperaturefroze the very blood in our veins  we could now endure the play hourpassed in the garden  sometimes on a sunny day it began even to bepleasant and genial  and a greenness grew over those brown beds which  freshening daily  suggested the thought that hope traversedthem at night  and left each morning brighter traces of her steps flowers peeped out amongst the leaves  snowdrops  crocuses  purpleauriculas  and golden eyed pansies  on thursday afternoons(half holidays) we now took walks  and found still sweeter flowersopening by the wayside  under the hedges
i discovered  too  that a great pleasure  an enjoyment which thehorizon only bounded  lay all outside the high and spike guarded wallsof our garden  this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summitsgirdling a great hill hollow  rich in verdure and shadow  in abright beck  full of dark stones and sparkling eddies  how differenthad this scene looked when i viewed it laid out beneath the iron skyof winter  stiffened in frost  shrouded with snow   when mists aschill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along thosepurple peaks  and rolled down  ing  and holm till they blended withthe frozen fog of the beck  that beck itself was then a torrent turbid and curbless  it tore asunder the wood  and sent a raving soundthrough the air  often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet  andfor the forest on its banks  that showed only ranks of skeletons
april advanced to may  a bright  serene may it was  days of bluesky  placid sunshine  and soft western or southern gales filled up itsduration  and now vegetation matured with vigour  lowood shook looseits tresses  it became all green  all flowery  its great elm  ash  andoak skeletons were restored to majestic life  woodland plants sprangup profusely in its recesses  unnumbered varieties of moss filledits hollows  and it made a strange ground sunshine out of the wealthof its wild primrose plants  i have seen their pale gold gleam inovershadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre  all this ienjoyed often and fully  free  unwatched  and almost alone  for thisunwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause  to which it nowbecomes my task to advert
have i not described a pleasant site for a dwelling  when i speakof it as bosomed in hill and wood  and rising from the verge of astream  assuredly  pleasant enough  but whether healthy or not isanother question
that forest dell  where lowood lay  was the cradle of fog andfog bred pestilence  which  quickening with the quickening spring crept into the orphan asylum  breathed typhus through its crowdedschoolroom and dormitory  and  ere may arrived  transformed theseminary into an hospital
semi starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of thepupils to receive infection  forty five out of the eighty girls layill at one time  classes were broken up  rules relaxed  the few whocontinued well were allowed almost unlimited license  because themedical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise tokeep them in health  and had it been otherwise  no one had leisureto watch or restrain them  miss temple s whole attention wasabsorbed by the patients  she lived in the sick room  never quittingit except to snatch a few hours  rest at night  the teachers werefully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparationsfor the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to havefriends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat ofcontagion  many  already smitten  went home only to die  some diedat the school  and were buried quietly and quickly  the nature ofthe malady forbidding delay
while disease had thus become an inhabitant of lowood  and deathits frequent visitor  while there was gloom and fear within its walls while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells  the drugand the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia ofmortality  that bright may shone unclouded over the bold hills andbeautiful woodland out of doors  its garden  too  glowed with flowers hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees  lilies had opened  tulipsand roses were in bloom  the borders of the little beds were gaywith pink thrift and crimson double daisies  the sweetbriars gave out morning and evening  their scent of spice and apples  and thesefragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of lowood except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms toput in a coffin
but i  and the rest who continued well  enjoyed fully thebeauties of the scene and season  they let us ramble in the wood  likegipsies  from morning till night  we did what we liked  went wherewe liked  we lived better too  mr  brocklehurst and his family nevercame near lowood now  household matters were not scrutinised into  thecross housekeeper was gone  driven away by the fear of infection her successor  who had been matron at the lowton dispensary  unused tothe ways of her new abode  provided with comparative liberality besides  there were fewer to feed  the sick could eat little  ourbreakfast basins were better filled  when there was no time to preparea regular dinner  which often happened  she would give us a largepiece of cold pie  or a thick slice of bread and cheese  and this wecarried away with us to the wood  where we each chose the spot weliked best  and dined sumptuously
my favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone  rising white anddry from the very middle of the beck  and only to be got at bywading through the water  a feat i accomplished barefoot  the stonewas just broad enough to accommodate  comfortably  another girl andme  at that time my chosen comrade  one mary ann wilson  a shrewd observant personage  whose society i took pleasure in  partlybecause she was witty and original  and partly because she had amanner which set me at my ease  some years older than i  she knew moreof the world  and could tell me many things i liked to hear  withher my curiosity found gratification  to my faults also she gave ampleindulgence  never imposing curb or rein on anything i said  she hada turn for narrative  i for analysis  she liked to inform  i toquestion  so we got on swimmingly together  deriving muchentertainment  if not much improvement  from our mutual intercourse
and where  meantime  was helen burns  why did i not spend thesesweet days of liberty with her  had i forgotten her  or was i soworthless as to have grown tired of her pure society  surely themary ann wilson i have mentioned was inferior to my firstacquaintance  she could only tell me amusing stories  andreciprocate any racy and pungent gossip i chose to indulge in while  if i have spoken truth of helen  she was qualified to givethose who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of farhigher things
true  reader  and i knew and felt this  and though i am a defectivebeing  with many faults and few redeeming points  yet i never tired ofhelen burns  nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment ofattachment  as strong  tender  and respectful as any that everanimated my heart  how could it be otherwise  when helen  at all timesand under all circumstances  evinced for me a quiet and faithfulfriendship  which ill humour never soured  nor irritation nevertroubled  but helen was ill at present  for some weeks she had beenremoved from my sight to i knew not what room upstairs  she was not  iwas told  in the hospital portion of the house with the feverpatients  for her complaint was consumption  not typhus  and byconsumption i  in my ignorance  understood something mild  whichtime and care would be sure to alleviate
i was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twicecoming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons  and being taken bymiss temple into the garden  but  on these occasions  i was notallowed to go and speak to her  i only saw her from the schoolroomwindow  and then not distinctly  for she was much wrapped up  andsat at a distance under the verandah
one evening  in the beginning of june  i had stayed out very latewith mary ann in the wood  we had  as usual  separated ourselvesfrom the others  and had wandered far  so far that we lost our way and had to ask it at a lonely cottage  where a man and woman lived who looked after a herd of half wild swine that fed on the mast in thewood  when we got back  it was after moonrise  a pony  which we knewto be the surgeon s  was standing at the garden door  mary annremarked that she supposed some one must be very ill  as mr  bates hadbeen sent for at that time of the evening  she went into the house i stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of rootsi had dug up in the forest  and which i feared would wither if ileft them till the morning  this done  i lingered yet a little longer the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell  it was such a pleasantevening  so serene  so warm  the still glowing west promised so fairlyanother fine day on the morrow  the moon rose with such majesty in thegrave east  i was noting these things and enjoying them as a childmight  when it entered my mind as it had never done before
how sad to be lying now on a sick bed  and to be in danger ofdying  this world is pleasant  it would be dreary to be called fromit  and to have to go who knows where
and then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend whathad been infused into it concerning heaven and hell  and for the firsttime it recoiled  baffled  and for the first time glancing behind on each side  and before it  it saw all round an unfathomed gulf  itfelt the one point where it stood  the present  all the rest wasformless cloud and vacant depth  and it shuddered at the thought oftottering  and plunging amid that chaos  while pondering this newidea  i heard the front door open  mr  bates came out  and with himwas a nurse  after she had seen him mount his horse and depart  shewas about to close the door  but i ran up to her
how is helen burns
very poorly   was the answer
is it her mr  bates has been to see
yes
and what does he say about her
he says she ll not be here long
this phrase  uttered in my hearing yesterday  would have onlyconveyed the notion that she was about to be removed tonorthumberland  to her own home  i should not have suspected that itmeant she was dying  but i knew instantly now  it opened clear on mycomprehension that helen burns was numbering her last days in thisworld  and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits  ifsuch region there were  i experienced a shock of horror  then a strongthrill of grief  then a desire  a necessity to see her  and i asked inwhat room she lay
she is in miss temple s room   said the nurse
may i go up and speak to her
oh no  child  it is not likely  and now it is time for you to comein  you ll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling
the nurse closed the front door  i went in by the side entrancewhich led to the schoolroom  i was just in time  it was nineo clock  and miss miller was calling the pupils to go to bed
it might be two hours later  probably near eleven  when i  nothaving been able to fall asleep  and deeming  from the perfect silenceof the dormitory  that my companions were all wrapt in profoundrepose  rose softly  put on my frock over my night dress  and  withoutshoes  crept from the apartment  and set off in quest of miss temple sroom  it was quite at the other end of the house  but i knew my way and the light of the unclouded summer moon  entering here and there atpassage windows  enabled me to find it without difficulty  an odour ofcamphor and burnt vinegar warned me when i came near the fever room and i passed its door quickly  fearful lest the nurse who sat up allnight should hear me  i dreaded being discovered and sent back  fori must see helen   i must embrace her before she died   i must giveher one last kiss  exchange with her one last word
having descended a staircase  traversed a portion of the housebelow  and succeeded in opening and shutting  without noise  twodoors  i reached another flight of steps  these i mounted  and thenjust opposite to me was miss temple s room  a light shone throughthe keyhole and from under the door  a profound stillness pervaded thevicinity  coming near  i found the door slightly ajar  probably toadmit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness  indisposed tohesitate  and full of impatient impulses  soul and senses quiveringwith keen throes  i put it back and looked in  my eye sought helen and feared to find death
close by miss temple s bed  and half covered with its whitecurtains  there stood a little crib  i saw the outline of a form underthe clothes  but the face was hid by the hangings  the nurse i hadspoken to in the garden sat in an easy chair asleep  an unsnuffedcandle burnt dimly on the table  miss temple was not to be seen  iknew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in thefever room  i advanced  then paused by the crib side  my hand was onthe curtain  but i preferred speaking before i withdrew it  i stillrecoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse
helen   i whispered softly   are you awake
she stirred herself  put back the curtain  and i saw her face pale  wasted  but quite composed  she looked so little changed that myfear was instantly dissipated
can it be you  jane   she asked  in her own gentle voice
oh   i thought   she is not going to die  they are mistaken  shecould not speak and look so calmly if she were
i got on to her crib and kissed her  her forehead was cold  and hercheek both cold and thin  and so were her hand and wrist  but shesmiled as of old
why are you come here  jane  it is past eleven o clock  i heard itstrike some minutes since
i came to see you  helen  i heard you were very ill  and i couldnot sleep till i had spoken to you
you came to bid me good bye  then  you are just in time probably
are you going somewhere  helen  are you going home
yes  to my long home  my last home
no  no  helen   i stopped  distressed  while i tried to devourmy tears  a fit of coughing seized helen  it did not  however  wakethe nurse  when it was over  she lay some minutes exhausted  thenshe whispered
jane  your little feet are bare  lie down and cover yourselfwith my quilt
i did so  she put her arm over me  and i nestled close to her after a long silence  she resumed  still whispering
i am very happy  jane  and when you hear that i am dead  youmust be sure and not grieve  there is nothing to grieve about  weall must die one day  and the illness which is removing me is notpainful  it is gentle and gradual  my mind is at rest  i leave noone to regret me much  i have only a father  and he is lately married and will not miss me  by dying young  i shall escape great sufferings i had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in theworld  i should have been continually at fault
but where are you going to  helen  can you see  do you know
i believe  i have faith  i am going to god
where is god  what is god
my maker and yours  who will never destroy what he created  i relyimplicitly on his power  and confide wholly in his goodness  i countthe hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me tohim  reveal him to me
you are sure  then  helen  that there is such a place as heaven and that our souls can get to it when we die
i am sure there is a future state  i believe god is good  i canresign my immortal part to him without any misgiving  god is myfather  god is my friend  i love him  i believe he loves me
and shall i see you again  helen  when i die
you will come to the same region of happiness  be received bythe same mighty  universal parent  no doubt  dear jane
again i questioned  but this time only in thought   where is thatregion  does it exist   and i clasped my arms closer around helen  sheseemed dearer to me than ever  i felt as if i could not let her go i lay with my face hidden on her neck  presently she said  in thesweetest tone
how comfortable i am  that last fit of coughing has tired me alittle  i feel as if i could sleep  but don t leave me  jane  i liketo have you near me
i ll stay with you  dear helen  no one shall take me away
are you warm  darling
yes
good night  jane
good night  helen
she kissed me  and i her  and we both soon slumbered
when i awoke it was day  an unusual movement roused me  i lookedup  i was in somebody s arms  the nurse held me  she was carrying methrough the passage back to the dormitory  i was not reprimanded forleaving my bed  people had something else to think about  noexplanation was afforded then to my many questions  but a day or twoafterwards i learned that miss temple  on returning to her own room atdawn  had found me laid in the little crib  my face against helenburns s shoulder  my arms round her neck  i was asleep  and helen was dead
her grave is in brocklebridge churchyard  for fifteen years afterher death it was only covered by a grassy mound  but now a grey marbletablet marks the spot  inscribed with her name  and the word resurgam

hitherto i have recorded in detail the events of my insignificantexistence  to the first ten years of my life i have given almost asmany chapters  but this is not to be a regular autobiography  i amonly bound to invoke memory where i know her responses will possesssome degree of interest  therefore i now pass a space of eight yearsalmost in silence  a few lines only are necessary to keep up the linksof connection
when the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation atlowood  it gradually disappeared from thence  but not till itsvirulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attentionon the school  inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge  and bydegrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in ahigh degree  the unhealthy nature of the site  the quantity andquality of the children s food  the brackish  fetid water used inits preparation  the pupils  wretched clothing and accommodations  allthese things were discovered  and the discovery produced a resultmortifying to mr  brocklehurst  but beneficial to the institution
several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribedlargely for the erection of a more convenient building in a bettersituation  new regulations were made  improvements in diet andclothing introduced  the funds of the school were intrusted to themanagement of a committee  mr  brocklehurst  who  from his wealthand family connections  could not be overlooked  still retained thepost of treasurer  but he was aided in the discharge of his dutiesby gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds  hisoffice of inspector  too  was shared by those who knew how tocombine reason with strictness  comfort with economy  compassionwith uprightness  the school  thus improved  became in time a trulyuseful and noble institution  i remained an inmate of its walls  afterits regeneration  for eight years  six as pupil  and two as teacher and in both capacities i bear my testimony to its value andimportance
during these eight years my life was uniform  but not unhappy because it was not inactive  i had the means of an excellent educationplaced within my reach  a fondness for some of my studies  and adesire to excel in all  together with a great delight in pleasing myteachers  especially such as i loved  urged me on  i availed myselffully of the advantages offered me  in time i rose to be the firstgirl of the first class  then i was invested with the office ofteacher  which i discharged with zeal for two years  but at the end ofthat time i altered
miss temple  through all changes  had thus far continuedsuperintendent of the seminary  to her instruction i owed the bestpart of my acquirements  her friendship and society had been mycontinual solace  she had stood me in the stead of mother governess  and  latterly  companion  at this period she married removed with her husband (a clergyman  an excellent man  almost worthyof such a wife) to a distant county  and consequently was lost to me
from the day she left i was no longer the same  with her was goneevery settled feeling  every association that had made lowood insome degree a home to me  i had imbibed from her something of hernature and much of her habits  more harmonious thoughts  what seemedbetter regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind  i hadgiven in allegiance to duty and order  i was quiet  i believed i wascontent  to the eyes of others  usually even to my own  i appeared adisciplined and subdued character
but destiny  in the shape of the rev  mr  nasmyth  came betweenme and miss temple  i saw her in her travelling dress step into apost chaise  shortly after the marriage ceremony  i watched the chaisemount the hill and disappear beyond its brow  and then retired to myown room  and there spent in solitude the greatest part of thehalf holiday granted in honour of the occasion
i walked about the chamber most of the time  i imagined myself onlyto be regretting my loss  and thinking how to repair it  but when myreflections were concluded  and i looked up and found that theafternoon was gone  and evening far advanced  another discovery dawnedon me  namely  that in the interval i had undergone a transformingprocess  that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of misstemple  or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmospherei had been breathing in her vicinity  and that now i was left in mynatural element  and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions it did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn  but rather as if a motivewere gone  it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me but the reason for tranquillity was no more  my world had for someyears been in lowood  my experience had been of its rules and systems now i remembered that the real world was wide  and that a varied fieldof hopes and fears  of sensations and excitements  awaited those whohad courage to go forth into its expanse  to seek real knowledge oflife amidst its perils
i went to my window  opened it  and looked out  there were thetwo wings of the building  there was the garden  there were the skirtsof lowood  there was the hilly horizon  my eye passed all otherobjects to rest on those most remote  the blue peaks  it was those ilonged to surmount  all within their boundary of rock and heath seemedprison ground  exile limits  i traced the white road winding round thebase of one mountain  and vanishing in a gorge between two  how ilonged to follow it farther  i recalled the time when i hadtravelled that very road in a coach  i remembered descending that hillat twilight  an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which broughtme first to lowood  and i had never quitted it since  my vacations hadall been spent at school  mrs  reed had never sent for me togateshead  neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visitme  i had had no communication by letter or message with the outerworld  school rules  school duties  school habits and notions  andvoices  and faces  and phrases  and costumes  and preferences  andantipathies  such was what i knew of existence  and now i felt that itwas not enough  i tired of the routine of eight years in oneafternoon  i desired liberty  for liberty i gasped  for liberty iuttered a prayer  it seemed scattered on the wind then faintlyblowing  i abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication  for change stimulus  that petition  too  seemed swept off into vague space  then   i cried  half desperate   grant me at least a new servitude
here a bell  ringing the hour of supper  called me downstairs
i was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflectionstill bedtime  even then a teacher who occupied the same room with mekept me from the subject to which i longed to recur  by a prolongedeffusion of small talk  how i wished sleep would silence her  itseemed as if  could i but go back to the idea which had last enteredmy mind as i stood at the window  some inventive suggestion would risefor my relief
miss gryce snored at last  she was a heavy welsh woman  and tillnow her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in anyother light than as a nuisance  to night i hailed the first deep noteswith satisfaction  i was debarrassed of interruption  myhalf effaced thought instantly revived
a new servitude  there is something in that   i soliloquised(mentally  be it understood  i did not talk aloud)   i know thereis  because it does not sound too sweet  it is not like such wordsas liberty  excitement  enjoyment  delightful sounds truly  but nomore than sounds for me  and so hollow and fleeting that it is merewaste of time to listen to them  but servitude  that must be matter offact  any one may serve  i have served here eight years  now all iwant is to serve elsewhere  can i not get so much of my own will  isnot the thing feasible  yes  yes  the end is not so difficult  if ihad only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attainingit
i sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain  it was a chillynight  i covered my shoulders with a shawl  and then i proceeded tothink again with all my might
what do i want  a new place  in a new house  amongst new faces under new circumstances  i want this because it is of no use wantinganything better  how do people do to get a new place  they apply tofriends  i suppose  i have no friends  there are many others whohave no friends  who must look about for themselves and be their ownhelpers  and what is their resource
i could not tell  nothing answered me  i then ordered my brain tofind a response  and quickly  it worked and worked faster  i feltthe pulses throb in my head and temples  but for nearly an hour itworked in chaos  and no result came of its efforts  feverish with vainlabour  i got up and took a turn in the room  undrew the curtain noted a star or two  shivered with cold  and again crept to bed
a kind fairy  in my absence  had surely dropped the requiredsuggestion on my pillow  for as i lay down  it came quietly andnaturally to my mind    those who want situations advertise  you
how  i know nothing about advertising
replies rose smooth and prompt now
you must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for itunder a cover directed to the editor of the herald  you must put it the first opportunity you have  into the post at lowton  answersmust be addressed to j  e   at the post office there  you can go andinquire in about a week after you send your letter  if any are come and act accordingly
this scheme i went over twice  thrice  it was then digested in mymind  i had it in a clear practical form  i felt satisfied  and fellasleep
with earliest day  i was up  i had my advertisement written enclosed  and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school  itran thus
a young lady accustomed to tuition  (had i not been a teachertwo years )  is desirous of meeting with a situation in a privatefamily where the children are under fourteen  (i thought that as i wasbarely eighteen  it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupilsnearer my own age)   she is qualified to teach the usual branches of agood english education  together with french  drawing  and music (in those days  reader  this now narrow catalogue ofaccomplishments  would have been held tolerably comprehensive)
this document remained locked in my drawer all day  after tea  iasked leave of the new superintendent to go to lowton  in order toperform some small commissions for myself and one or two of myfellow teachers  permission was readily granted  i went  it was a walkof two miles  and the evening was wet  but the days were still long  ivisited a shop or two  slipped the letter into the post office  andcame back through heavy rain  with streaming garments  but with arelieved heart
the succeeding week seemed long  it came to an end at last however  like all sublunary things  and once more  towards the closeof a pleasant autumn day  i found myself afoot on the road tolowton  a picturesque track it was  by the way  lying along the sideof the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale  but thatday i thought more of the letters  that might or might not be awaitingme at the little burgh whither i was bound  than of the charms oflea and water
my ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for apair of shoes  so i discharged that business first  and when it wasdone  i stepped across the clean and quiet little street from theshoemaker s to the post office  it was kept by an old dame  who worehorn spectacles on her nose  and black mittens on her hands
are there any letters for j  e    i asked
she peered at me over her spectacles  and then she opened adrawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time  so long that myhopes began to falter  at last  having held a document before herglasses for nearly five minutes  she presented it across thecounter  accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustfulglance  it was for j  e
is there only one   i demanded
there are no more   said she  and i put it in my pocket and turnedmy face homeward  i could not open it then  rules obliged me to beback by eight  and it was already half past seven
various duties awaited me on my arrival  i had to sit with thegirls during their hour of study  then it was my turn to read prayers to see them to bed  afterwards i supped with the other teachers even when we finally retired for the night  the inevitable missgryce was still my companion  we had only a short end of candle in ourcandlestick  and i dreaded lest she should talk till it was allburnt out  fortunately  however  the heavy supper she had eatenproduced a soporific effect  she was already snoring before i hadfinished undressing  there still remained an inch of candle  i nowtook out my letter  the seal was an initial f   i broke it  thecontents were brief thursday  possesses the acquirements mentioned  and if she is in aposition to give satisfactory references as to character andcompetency  a situation can be offered her where there is but onepupil  a little girl  under ten years of age  and where the salaryis thirty pounds per annum  j  e  is requested to send references name  address  and all particulars to the direction
i examined the document long  the writing was old fashioned andrather uncertain  like that of an elderly lady  this circumstancewas satisfactory  a private fear had haunted me  that in thus actingfor myself  and by my own guidance  i ran the risk of getting intosome scrape  and  above all things  i wished the result of myendeavours to be respectable  proper  en regle  i now felt that anelderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business i had on hand  mrs fairfax  i saw her in a black gown and widow s cap  frigid  perhaps but not uncivil  a model of elderly english respectability thornfield  that  doubtless  was the name of her house  a neat orderlyspot  i was sure  though i failed in my efforts to conceive arecollections of the map of england  yes  i saw it  both the shire andcounty where i now resided  that was a recommendation to me  ilonged to go where there was life and movement  millcote was a largedoubtless  so much the better  it would be a complete change at least not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys andclouds of smoke   but   i argued   thornfield will  probably  be agood way from the town
here the socket of the candle dropped  and the wick went out
next day new steps were to be taken  my plans could no longer beconfined to my own breast  i must impart them in order to achievetheir success  having sought and obtained an audience of thesuperintendent during the noontide recreation  i told her i had aprospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be doublewhat i now received (for at lowood i only got l15 per annum)  andrequested she would break the matter for me to mr  brocklehurst  orsome of the committee  and ascertain whether they would permit me tomention them as references  she obligingly consented to act asmediatrix in the matter  the next day she laid the affair before mr brocklehurst  who said that mrs  reed must be written to  as she wasmy natural guardian  a note was accordingly addressed to that lady who returned for answer  that  i might do as i pleased  she had longrelinquished all interference in my affairs   this note went the roundof the committee  and at last  after what appeared to me mosttedious delay  formal leave was given me to better my condition if icould  and an assurance added  that as i had always conducted myselfwell  both as teacher and pupil  at lowood  a testimonial of characterand capacity  signed by the inspectors of that institution  shouldforthwith be furnished me
this testimonial i accordingly received in about a month  forwardeda copy of it to mrs  fairfax  and got that lady s reply  statingthat she was satisfied  and fixing that day fortnight as the periodfor my assuming the post of governess in her house
i now busied myself in preparations  the fortnight passedrapidly  i had not a very large wardrobe  though it was adequate to mywants  and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk   the same i hadbrought with me eight years ago from gateshead
the box was corded  the card nailed on  in half an hour the carrierwas to call for it to take it to lowton  whither i myself was torepair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach  i hadbrushed my black stuff travelling dress  prepared my bonnet  gloves and muff  sought in all my drawers to see that no article was leftbehind  and now having nothing more to do  i sat down and tried torest  i could not  though i had been on foot all day  i could notnow repose an instant  i was too much excited  a phase of my lifewas closing tonight  a new one opening to morrow  impossible toslumber in the interval  i must watch feverishly while the changewas being accomplished
miss   said a servant who met me in the lobby  where i waswandering like a troubled spirit   a person below wishes to see you
the carrier  no doubt   i thought  and ran downstairs withoutinquiry  i was passing the back parlour or teachers  sitting room  thedoor of which was half open  to go to the kitchen  when some one ranout
it s her  i am sure   i could have told her anywhere   cried theindividual who stopped my progress and took my hand
i looked  i saw a woman attired like a well dressed servant matronly  yet still young  very good looking  with black hair andeyes  and lively complexion
well  who is it   she asked  in a voice and with a smile i halfrecognised   you ve not quite forgotten me  i think  miss jane
in another second i was embracing and kissing her rapturously  bessie  bessie  bessie   that was all i said  whereat she halflaughed  half cried  and we both went into the parlour  by the firestood a little fellow of three years old  in plaid frock and trousers
that is my little boy   said bessie directly
then you are married  bessie
yes  nearly five years since to robert leaven  the coachman  andi ve a little girl besides bobby there  that i ve christened jane
and you don t live at gateshead
i live at the lodge  the old porter has left
well  and how do they all get on  tell me everything about them bessie  but sit down first  and  bobby  come and sit on my knee will you   but bobby preferred sidling over to his mother
you re not grown so very tall  miss jane  nor so very stout  continued mrs  leaven   i daresay they ve not kept you too well atschool  miss reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are  andmiss georgiana would make two of you in breadth
georgiana is handsome  i suppose  bessie
very  she went up to london last winter with her mama  and thereeverybody admired her  and a young lord fell in love with her  but hisrelations were against the match  and  what do you think   he and missgeorgiana made it up to run away  but they were found out and stopped it was miss reed that found them out  i believe she was envious  andnow she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together  they arealways quarrelling
well  and what of john reed
oh  he is not doing so well as his mama could wish  he went tocollege  and he got  plucked  i think they call it  and then hisuncles wanted him to be a barrister  and study the law  but he is sucha dissipated young man  they will never make much of him  i think
what does he look like
he is very tall  some people call him a fine looking young man but he has such thick lips
and mrs  reed
missis looks stout and well enough in the face  but i thinkshe s not quite easy in her mind  mr  john s conduct does not pleaseher  he spends a deal of money
did she send you here  bessie
no  indeed  but i have long wanted to see you  and when i heardthat there had been a letter from you  and that you were going toanother part of the country  i thought i d just set off  and get alook at you before you were quite out of my reach
i am afraid you are disappointed in me  bessie   i said thislaughing  i perceived that bessie s glance  though it expressedregard  did in no shape denote admiration
no  miss jane  not exactly  you are genteel enough  you looklike a lady  and it is as much as ever i expected of you  you wereno beauty as a child
i smiled at bessie s frank answer  i felt that it was correct but i confess i was not quite indifferent to its import  at eighteenmost people wish to please  and the conviction that they have not anexterior likely to second that desire brings anything butgratification
i daresay you are clever  though   continued bessie  by way ofsolace   what can you do  can you play on the piano
a little
there was one in the room  bessie went and opened it  and thenasked me to sit down and give her a tune  i played a waltz or two  andshe was charmed
the miss reeds could not play as well   said she exultingly   ialways said you would surpass them in learning  and can you draw
that is one of my paintings over the chimney piece   it was alandscape in water colours  of which i had made a present to thesuperintendent  in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with thecommittee on my behalf  and which she had framed and glazed
well  that is beautiful  miss jane  it is as fine a picture as anymiss reed s drawing master could paint  let alone the young ladiesthemselves  who could not come near it  and have you learnt french
yes  bessie  i can both read it and speak it
and you can work on muslin and canvas
i can
oh  you are quite a lady  miss jane  i knew you would be  you willget on whether your relations notice you or not  there was something iwanted to ask you  have you ever heard anything from your father skinsfolk  the eyres
never in my life
well  you know  missis always said they were poor and quitedespicable  and they may be poor  but i believe they are as muchgentry as the reeds are  for one day  nearly seven years ago  a mr eyre came to gateshead and wanted to see you  missis said you wereat school fifty miles off  he seemed so much disappointed  for hecould not stay  he was going on a voyage to a foreign country  and theship was to sail from london in a day or two  he looked quite agentleman  and i believe he was your father s brother
what foreign country was he going to  bessie
an island thousands of miles off  where they make wine  the butlerdid tell me
madeira   i suggested
yes  that is it  that is the very word
so he went
yes  he did not stay many minutes in the house  missis was veryhigh with him  she called him afterwards a "sneaking tradesman " myrobert believes he was a wine merchant
very likely   i returned   or perhaps clerk or agent to awine merchant
bessie and i conversed about old times an hour longer  and then shewas obliged to leave me  i saw her again for a few minutes the nextmorning at lowton  while i was waiting for the coach  we partedfinally at the door of the brocklehurst arms there  each went herseparate way  she set off for the brow of lowood fell to meet theconveyance which was to take her back to gateshead  i mounted thevehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in theunknown environs of millcote
chapter xi
a new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play and when i draw up the curtain this time  reader  you must fancy yousee a room in the george inn at millcote  with such large figuredpapering on the walls as inn rooms have  such a carpet  suchfurniture  such ornaments on the mantel piece  such prints including a portrait of george the third  and another of the prince ofwales  and a representation of the death of wolfe  all this is visibleto you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling  and bythat of an excellent fire  near which i sit in my cloak and bonnet  mymuff and umbrella lie on the table  and i am warming away the numbnessand chill contracted by sixteen hours  exposure to the rawness of anoctober day  i left lowton at four o clock a m   and the millcote townclock is now just striking eight
reader  though i look comfortably accommodated  i am not verytranquil in my mind  i thought when the coach stopped here there wouldbe some one to meet me  i looked anxiously round as i descended thewooden steps the  boots  placed for my convenience  expecting tohear my name pronounced  and to see some description of carriagewaiting to convey me to thornfield  nothing of the sort was visible and when i asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after amiss eyre  i was answered in the negative  so i had no resource but torequest to be shown into a private room  and here i am waiting while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts
it is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feelitself quite alone in the world  cut adrift from every connection uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached  andprevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted the charm of adventure sweetens that sensation  the glow of pridewarms it  but then the throb of fear disturbs it  and fear with mebecame predominant when half an hour elapsed and still i was alone i bethought myself to ring the bell
is there a place in this neighbourhood called thornfield   i askedof the waiter who answered the summons
thornfield  i don t know  ma am  i ll inquire at the bar   hevanished  but reappeared instantly
is your name eyre  miss
yes
person here waiting for you
i jumped up  took my muff and umbrella  and hastened into theinn passage  a man was standing by the open door  and in thelamp lit street i dimly saw a one horse conveyance
this will be your luggage  i suppose   said the man ratherabruptly when he saw me  pointing to my trunk in the passage
yes   he hoisted it on to the vehicle  which was a sort of car and then i got in  before he shut me up  i asked him how far it was tothornfield
a matter of six miles
how long shall we be before we get there
happen an hour and a half
he fastened the car door  climbed to his own seat outside  and weset off  our progress was leisurely  and gave me ample time toreflect  i was content to be at length so near the end of myjourney  and as i leaned back in the comfortable though not elegantconveyance  i meditated much at my ease
i suppose   thought i   judging from the plainness of theservant and carriage  mrs  fairfax is not a very dashing person  somuch the better  i never lived amongst fine people but once  and i wasvery miserable with them  i wonder if she lives alone except thislittle girl  if so  and if she is in any degree amiable  i shallsurely be able to get on with her  i will do my best  it is a pitythat doing one s best does not always answer  at lowood  indeed  itook that resolution  kept it  and succeeded in pleasing  but withmrs  reed  i remember my best was always spurned with scorn  i praygod mrs  fairfax may not turn out a second mrs  reed  but if she does i am not bound to stay with her  let the worst come to the worst  ican advertise again  how far are we on our road now  i wonder
i let down the window and looked out  millcote was behind us judging by the number of its lights  it seemed a place of considerablemagnitude  much larger than lowton  we were now  as far as i couldsee  on a sort of common  but there were houses scattered all over thedistrict  i felt we were in a different region to lowood  morepopulous  less picturesque  more stirring  less romantic
the roads were heavy  the night misty  my conductor let his horsewalk all the way  and the hour and a half extended  i verilybelieve  to two hours  at last he turned in his seat and said
you re noan so far fro  thornfield now
again i looked out  we were passing a church  i saw its low broadtower against the sky  and its bell was tolling a quarter  i saw anarrow galaxy of lights too  on a hillside  marking a village orhamlet  about ten minutes after  the driver got down and opened a pairof gates  we passed through  and they clashed to behind us  we nowslowly ascended a drive  and came upon the long front of a house candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow window  all the rest weredark  the car stopped at the front door  it was opened by amaid servant  i alighted and went in
will you walk this way  ma am   said the girl  and i followedher across a square hall with high doors all round  she ushered meinto a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at firstdazzled me  contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyeshad been for two hours inured  when i could see  however  a cosy andagreeable picture presented itself to my view
a snug small room  a round table by a cheerful fire  an arm chairhigh backed and old fashioned  wherein sat the neatest imaginablelittle elderly lady  in widow s cap  black silk gown  and snowy muslinapron  exactly like what i had fancied mrs  fairfax  only less statelyand milder looking  she was occupied in knitting  a large cat satdemurely at her feet  nothing in short was wanting to complete thebeau ideal of domestic comfort  a more reassuring introduction for anew governess could scarcely be conceived  there was no grandeur tooverwhelm  no stateliness to embarrass  and then  as i entered  theold lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me
how do you do  my dear  i am afraid you have had a tedious ride john drives so slowly  you must be cold  come to the fire
mrs  fairfax  i suppose   said i
yes  you are right  do sit down
she conducted me to her own chair  and then began to remove myshawl and untie my bonnet strings  i begged she would not give herselfso much trouble
oh  it is no trouble  i daresay your own hands are almost numbedwith cold  leah  make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two here are the keys of the storeroom
and she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch ofkeys  and delivered them to the servant
now  then  draw nearer to the fire   she continued   you vebrought your luggage with you  haven t you  my dear
yes  ma am
i ll see it carried into your room   she said  and bustled out
she treats me like a visitor   thought i   i little expectedsuch a reception  i anticipated only coldness and stiffness  this isnot like what i have heard of the treatment of governesses  but i mustnot exult too soon
she returned  with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus anda book or two from the table  to make room for the tray which leah nowbrought  and then herself handed me the refreshments  i felt ratherconfused at being the object of more attention than i had everbefore received  and  that too  shown by my employer and superior  butas she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything outof her place  i thought it better to take her civilities quietly
shall i have the pleasure of seeing miss fairfax to night   iasked  when i had partaken of what she offered me
what did you say  my dear  i am a little deaf   returned thegood lady  approaching her ear to my mouth
i repeated the question more distinctly
miss fairfax  oh  you mean miss varens  varens is the name of yourfuture pupil
indeed  then she is not your daughter
no   i have no family
i should have followed up my first inquiry  by asking in what waymiss varens was connected with her  but i recollected it was notpolite to ask too many questions  besides  i was sure to hear in time
i am so glad   she continued  as she sat down opposite to me and took the cat on her knee   i am so glad you are come  it will bequite pleasant living here now with a companion  to be sure it ispleasant at any time  for thornfield is a fine old hall  ratherneglected of late years perhaps  but still it is a respectableplace  yet you know in winter time one feels dreary quite alone in thebest quarters  i say alone  leah is a nice girl to be sure  and johnand his wife are very decent people  but then you see they are onlyservants  and one can t converse with them on terms of equality  onemust keep them at due distance  for fear of losing one s authority i m sure last winter (it was a very severe one  if you recollect and when it did not snow  it rained and blew)  not a creature butthe butcher and postman came to the house  from november tillfebruary  and i really got quite melancholy with sitting night afternight alone  i had leah in to read to me sometimes  but i don tthink the poor girl liked the task much  she felt it confining  inspring and summer one got on better  sunshine and long days makesuch a difference  and then  just at the commencement of thisautumn  little adela varens came and her nurse  a child makes ahouse alive all at once  and now you are here i shall be quite gay
my heart really warmed to the worthy lady as i heard her talk and i drew my chair a little nearer to her  and expressed my sincerewish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated
but i ll not keep you sitting up late to night   said she   itis on the stroke of twelve now  and you have been travelling allday  you must feel tired  if you have got your feet well warmed i ll show you your bedroom  i ve had the room next to mine preparedfor you  it is only a small apartment  but i thought you would like itbetter than one of the large front chambers  to be sure they havefiner furniture  but they are so dreary and solitary  i never sleep inthem myself
i thanked her for her considerate choice  and as i really feltfatigued with my long journey  expressed my readiness to retire  shetook her candle  and i followed her from the room  first she went tosee if the hall door was fastened  having taken the key from the lock she led the way upstairs  the steps and banisters were of oak  thestaircase window was high and latticed  both it and the long galleryinto which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to achurch rather than a house  a very chill and vault like air pervadedthe stairs and gallery  suggesting cheerless ideas of space andsolitude  and i was glad  when finally ushered into my chamber  tofind it of small dimensions  and furnished in ordinary  modern style
when mrs  fairfax had bidden me a kind good night  and i hadfastened my door  gazed leisurely round  and in some measure effacedthe eerie impression made by that wide hall  that dark and spaciousstaircase  and that long  cold gallery  by the livelier aspect of mylittle room  i remembered that  after a day of bodily fatigue andmental anxiety  i was now at last in safe haven  the impulse ofgratitude swelled my heart  and i knelt down at the bedside  andoffered up thanks where thanks were due  not forgetting  ere i rose to implore aid on my further path  and the power of meriting thekindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned  mycouch had no thorns in it that night  my solitary room no fears  atonce weary and content  i slept soon and soundly  when i awoke itwas broad day
the chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sunshone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains  showingpapered walls and a carpeted floor  so unlike the bare planks andstained plaster of lowood  that my spirits rose at the view  externalshave a great effect on the young  i thought that a fairer era oflife was beginning for me  one that was to have its flowers andpleasures  as well as its thorns and toils  my faculties  roused bythe change of scene  the new field offered to hope  seemed allastir  i cannot precisely define what they expected  but it wassomething pleasant  not perhaps that day or that month  but at anindefinite future period
i rose  i dressed myself with care  obliged to be plain  for ihad no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity i was still by nature solicitous to be neat  it was not my habit to bedisregardful of appearance or careless of the impression i made  onthe contrary  i ever wished to look as well as i could  and toplease as much as my want of beauty would permit  i sometimesregretted that i was not handsomer  i sometimes wished to have rosycheeks  a straight nose  and small cherry mouth  i desired to be tall stately  and finely developed in figure  i felt it a misfortune that iwas so little  so pale  and had features so irregular and so marked and why had i these aspirations and these regrets  it would bedifficult to say  i could not then distinctly say it to myself  yeti had a reason  and a logical  natural reason too  however  when i hadbrushed my hair very smooth  and put on my black frock  which quakerlike as it was  at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety and adjusted my clean white tucker  i thought i should dorespectably enough to appear before mrs  fairfax  and that my newpupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy  havingopened my chamber window  and seen that i left all things straight andneat on the toilet table  i ventured forth
traversing the long and matted gallery  i descended the slipperysteps of oak  then i gained the hall  i halted there a minute  ilooked at some pictures on the walls (one  i remember  represented agrim man in a cuirass  and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearlnecklace)  at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling  at a great clockwhose case was of oak curiously carved  and ebon black with time andrubbing  everything appeared very stately and imposing to me  but theni was so little accustomed to grandeur  the hall door  which washalf of glass  stood open  i stepped over the threshold  it was a fineautumn morning  the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves andstill green fields  advancing on to the lawn  i looked up and surveyedthe front of the mansion  it was three storeys high  of proportionsnot vast  though considerable  a gentleman s manor house  not anobleman s seat  battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery whose cawing tenants were now on the wing  they flew over the lawn andgrounds to alight in a great meadow  from which these were separatedby a sunk fence  and where an array of mighty old thorn trees  strong knotty  and broad as oaks  at once explained the etymology of themansion s designation  farther off were hills  not so lofty as thoseround lowood  nor so craggy  nor so like barriers of separation fromthe living world  but yet quiet and lonely hills enough  and seemingto embrace thornfield with a seclusion i had not expected to findexistent so near the stirring locality of millcote  a little hamlet whose roofs were blent with trees  straggled up the side of one ofthese hills  the church of the district stood nearer thornfield  itsold tower top looked over a knoll between the house and gates
i was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air  yetlistening with delight to the cawing of the rooks  yet surveying thewide  hoary front of the hall  and thinking what a great place itwas for one lonely little dame like mrs  fairfax to inhabit  when thatlady appeared at the door
what  out already   said she   i see you are an early riser   iwent up to her  and was received with an affable kiss and shake of thehand
how do you like thornfield   she asked  i told her i liked it verymuch
yes   she said   it is a pretty place  but i fear it will begetting out of order  unless mr  rochester should take it into hishead to come and reside here permanently  or  at least  visit itrather oftener  great houses and fine grounds require the presenceof the proprietor
mr  rochester   i exclaimed   who is he
the owner of thornfield   she responded quietly   did you not knowhe was called rochester
of course i did not  i had never heard of him before  but the oldlady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understoodfact  with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct
i thought   i continued   thornfield belonged to you
to me  bless you  child  what an idea  to me  i am only thehousekeeper  the manager  to be sure i am distantly related to therochesters by the mother s side  or at least my husband was  he wasa clergyman  incumbent of hay  that little village yonder on the hill and that church near the gates was his  the present mr  rochester smother was a fairfax  second cousin to my husband  but i never presumeon the connection  in fact  it is nothing to me  i consider myselfquite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper  my employer is alwayscivil  and i expect nothing more
and the little girl  my pupil
she is mr  rochester s ward  he commissioned me to find abelieve  here she comes  with her "bonne " as she calls her nurse  the enigma then was explained  this affable and kind little widowwas no great dame  but a dependant like myself  i did not like her theworse for that  on the contrary  i felt better pleased than ever the equality between her and me was real  not the mere result ofcondescension on her part  so much the better  my position was all thefreer
as i was meditating on this discovery  a little girl  followed byher attendant  came running up the lawn  i looked at my pupil  who didnot at first appear to notice me  she was quite a child  perhaps sevenor eight years old  slightly built  with a pale  small featuredface  and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist
good morning  miss adela   said mrs  fairfax   come and speak tothe lady who is to teach you  and to make you a clever woman someday   she approached
c est la ma gouvernante   said she  pointing to me  and addressingher nurse  who answered
mais oui  certainement
are they foreigners   i inquired  amazed at hearing the frenchlanguage
the nurse is a foreigner  and adela was born on the continent and  i believe  never left it till within six months ago  when shefirst came here she could speak no english  now she can make shiftto talk it a little  i don t understand her  she mixes it so withfrench  but you will make out her meaning very well  i daresay
fortunately i had had the advantage of being taught french by afrench lady  and as i had always made a point of conversing withmadame pierrot as often as i could  and had besides  during the lastseven years  learnt a portion of french by heart daily  applyingmyself to take pains with my accent  and imitating as closely aspossible the pronunciation of my teacher  i had acquired a certaindegree of readiness and correctness in the language  and was notlikely to be much at a loss with mademoiselle adela  she came andshook hands with me when she heard that i was her governess  and asi led her in to breakfast  i addressed some phrases to her in herown tongue  she replied briefly at first  but after we were seatedat the table  and she had examined me some ten minutes with herlarge hazel eyes  she suddenly commenced chattering fluently
ah   cried she  in french   you speak my language as well as mr rochester does  i can talk to you as i can to him  and so cansophie  she will be glad  nobody here understands her  madamefairfax is all english  sophie is my nurse  she came with me overthe sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked  how it did smoke  and i was sick  and so was sophie  and so was mr  rochester  mr rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon  andsophie and i had little beds in another place  i nearly fell out ofmine  it was like a shelf  and mademoiselle  what is your name
eyre  jane eyre
aire  bah  i cannot say it  well  our ship stopped in the morning before it was quite daylight  at a great city  a huge city  withvery dark houses and all smoky  not at all like the pretty cleantown i came from  and mr  rochester carried me in his arms over aplank to the land  and sophie came after  and we all got into a coach which took us to a beautiful large house  larger than this andfiner  called an hotel  we stayed there nearly a week  i and sophieused to walk every day in a great green place full of trees  calledthe park  and there were many children there besides me  and a pondwith beautiful birds in it  that i fed with crumbs
can you understand her when she runs on so fast   asked mrs fairfax
i understood her very well  for i had been accustomed to the fluenttongue of madame pierrot
i wish   continued the good lady   you would ask her a question ortwo about her parents  i wonder if she remembers them
adele   i inquired   with whom did you live when you were inthat pretty clean town you spoke of
i lived long ago with mama  but she is gone to the holy virgin mama used to teach me to dance and sing  and to say verses  a greatmany gentlemen and ladies came to see mama  and i used to dance beforethem  or to sit on their knees and sing to them  i liked it  shall ilet you hear me sing now
she had finished her breakfast  so i permitted her to give aspecimen of her accomplishments  descending from her chair  she cameand placed herself on my knee  then  folding her little hands demurelybefore her  shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to theceiling  she commenced singing a song from some opera  it was thestrain of a forsaken lady  who  after bewailing the perfidy of herlover  calls pride to her aid  desires her attendant to deck her inher brightest jewels and richest robes  and resolves to meet the falseone that night at a ball  and prove to him  by the gaiety of herdemeanour  how little his desertion has affected her
the subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer  but isuppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of loveand jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood  and in very bad tastethat point was  at least i thought so
adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough  and with the naivete ofher age  this achieved  she jumped from my knee and said   now mademoiselle  i will repeat you some poetry
assuming an attitude  she began  la ligue des rats  fable de lafontaine   she then declaimed the little piece with an attention topunctuation and emphasis  a flexibility of voice and anappropriateness of gesture  very unusual indeed at her age  andwhich proved she had been carefully trained
was it your mama who taught you that piece   i asked
yes  and she just used to say it in this way  "qu avez vousdonc  lui dit un de ces rats  parlez " she made me lift my hand  so to remind me to raise my voice at the question  now shall i dancefor you
no  that will do  but after your mama went to the holy virgin as you say  with whom did you live then
with madame frederic and her husband  she took care of me  but sheis nothing related to me  i think she is poor  for she had not so finea house as mama  i was not long there  mr  rochester asked me if iwould like to go and live with him in england  and i said yes  for iknew mr  rochester before i knew madame frederic  and he was alwayskind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys  but you see he has notkept his word  for he has brought me to england  and now he is goneback again himself  and i never see him
after breakfast  adele and i withdrew to the library  which room it appears  mr  rochester had directed should be used as theschoolroom  most of the books were locked up behind glass doors  butthere was one bookcase left open containing everything that could beneeded in the way of elementary works  and several volumes of lightliterature  poetry  biography  travels  a few romances  etc  i supposehe had considered that these were all the governess would requirefor her private perusal  and  indeed  they contented me amply forthe present  compared with the scanty pickings i had now and then beenable to glean at lowood  they seemed to offer an abundant harvest ofentertainment and information  in this room  too  there was acabinet piano  quite new and of superior tone  also an easel forpainting and a pair of globes
i found my pupil sufficiently docile  though disinclined toapply  she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind  i feltit would be injudicious to confine her too much at first  so  when ihad talked to her a great deal  and got her to learn a little  andwhen the morning had advanced to noon  i allowed her to return toher nurse  i then proposed to occupy myself till dinner time indrawing some little sketches for her use
as i was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils  mrs fairfax called to me   your morning school hours are over now  isuppose   said she  she was in a room the folding doors of which stoodopen  i went in when she addressed me  it was a large  statelyapartment  with purple chairs and curtains  a turkey carpet walnut panelled walls  one vast window rich in stained glass  and alofty ceiling  nobly moulded  mrs  fairfax was dusting some vases offine purple spar  which stood on a sideboard
what a beautiful room   i exclaimed  as i looked round  for ihad never before seen any half so imposing
yes  this is the dining room  i have just opened the window  tolet in a little air and sunshine  for everything gets so damp inapartments that are seldom inhabited  the drawing room yonder feelslike a vault
she pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window  and hunglike it with a tyrian dyed curtain  now looped up  mounting to it bytwo broad steps  and looking through  i thought i caught a glimpseof a fairy place  so bright to my novice eyes appeared the viewbeyond  yet it was merely a very pretty drawing room  and within ita boudoir  both spread with white carpets  on which seemed laidbrilliant garlands of flowers  both ceiled with snowy mouldings ofwhite grapes and vine leaves  beneath which glowed in rich contrastcrimson couches and ottomans  while the ornaments on the pale parianmantelpiece were of sparkling bohemian glass  ruby red  and betweenthe windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow andfire
in what order you keep these rooms  mrs  fairfax   said i   nodust  no canvas coverings  except that the air feels chilly  one wouldthink they were inhabited daily
why  miss eyre  though mr  rochester s visits here are rare they are always sudden and unexpected  and as i observed that it puthim out to find everything swathed up  and to have a bustle ofarrangement on his arrival  i thought it best to keep the rooms inreadiness
is mr  rochester an exacting  fastidious sort of man
not particularly so  but he has a gentleman s tastes and habits and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them
do you like him  is he generally liked
oh  yes  the family have always been respected here  almost allthe land in this neighbourhood  as far as you can see  has belonged tothe rochesters time out of mind
well  but  leaving his land out of the question  do you likehim  is he liked for himself
i have no cause to do otherwise than like him  and i believe he isconsidered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants  but he hasnever lived much amongst them
but has he no peculiarities  what  in short  is his character
oh  his character is unimpeachable  i suppose  he is ratherpeculiar  perhaps  he has travelled a great deal  and seen a greatdeal of the world  i should think  i daresay he is clever  but i neverhad much conversation with him
in what way is he peculiar
i don t know  it is not easy to describe  nothing striking  butyou feel it when he speaks to you  you cannot be always sure whetherhe is in jest or earnest  whether he is pleased or the contrary  youdon t thoroughly understand him  in short  at least  i don t  but itis of no consequence  he is a very good master
this was all the account i got from mrs  fairfax of her employerand mine  there are people who seem to have no notion of sketching acharacter  or observing and describing salient points  either inpersons or things  the good lady evidently belonged to this class my queries puzzled  but did not draw her out  mr  rochester was mr rochester in her eyes  a gentleman  a landed proprietor  nothing more she inquired and searched no further  and evidently wondered at mywish to gain a more definite notion of his identity
when we left the dining room she proposed to show me over therest of the house  and i followed her upstairs and downstairs admiring as i went  for all was well arranged and handsome  thelarge front chambers i thought especially grand  and some of thethird storey rooms  though dark and low  were interesting from theirair of antiquity  the furniture once appropriated to the lowerapartments had from time to time been removed here  as fashionschanged  and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casementshowed bed steads of a hundred years old  chests in oak or walnut looking  with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs heads  like types of the hebrew ark  rows of venerable chairs high backed and narrow  stools still more antiquated  on whosecushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half effacedembroideries  wrought by fingers that for two generations had beencoffin dust  all these relics gave to the third storey of thornfieldhall the aspect of a home of the past  a shrine of memory  i liked thehush  the gloom  the quaintness of these retreats in the day  but i byno means coveted a night s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds shut in  some of them  with doors of oak  shaded  others  with wroughtold english hangings crusted with thick work  portraying effigies ofstrange flowers  and stranger birds  and strangest human beings  all which would have looked strange  indeed  by the pallid gleam ofmoonlight
do the servants sleep in these rooms   i asked
no  they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back  noone ever sleeps here  one would almost say that  if there were a ghostat thornfield hall  this would be its haunt
so i think  you have no ghost  then
none that i ever heard of   returned mrs  fairfax  smiling
nor any traditions of one  no legends or ghost stories
i believe not  and yet it is said the rochesters have beenrather a violent than a quiet race in their time  perhaps  though that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now
yes  "after life s fitful fever they sleep well "  i muttered  where are you going now  mrs  fairfax   for she was moving away
on to the leads  will you come and see the view from thence   ifollowed still  up a very narrow staircase to the attics  and thenceby a ladder and through a trap door to the roof of the hall  i was nowon a level with the crow colony  and could see into their nests leaning over the battlements and looking far down  i surveyed thegrounds laid out like a map  the bright and velvet lawn closelygirdling the grey base of the mansion  the field  wide as a park dotted with its ancient timber  the wood  dun and sere  divided by apath visibly overgrown  greener with moss than the trees were withfoliage  the church at the gates  the road  the tranquil hills  allreposing in the autumn day s sun  the horizon bounded by apropitious sky  azure  marbled with pearly white  no feature in thescene was extraordinary  but all was pleasing  when i turned from itand repassed the trap door  i could scarcely see my way down theladder  the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch ofblue air to which i had been looking up  and to that sunlit scene ofgrove  pasture  and green hill  of which the hall was the centre and over which i had been gazing with delight
mrs  fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap door  i by dint of groping  found the outlet from the attic  and proceededto descend the narrow garret staircase  i lingered in the long passageto which this led  separating the front and back rooms of the thirdstorey  narrow  low  and dim  with only one little window at the farend  and looking  with its two rows of small black doors all shut like a corridor in some bluebeard s castle
while i paced softly on  the last sound i expected to hear in sostill a region  a laugh  struck my ear  it was a curious laugh distinct  formal  mirthless  i stopped  the sound ceased  only foran instant  it began again  louder  for at first  though distinct it was very low  it passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wakean echo in every lonely chamber  though it originated but in one and i could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued
mrs  fairfax   i called out  for i now heard her descending thegreat stairs   did you hear that loud laugh  who is it
some of the servants  very likely   she answered   perhaps gracepoole
did you hear it   i again inquired
yes  plainly  i often hear her  she sews in one of these rooms sometimes leah is with her  they are frequently noisy together
the laugh was repeated in its low  syllabic tone  and terminated inan odd murmur
grace   exclaimed mrs  fairfax
i really did not expect any grace to answer  for the laugh was astragic  as preternatural a laugh as any i ever heard  and  but that itwas high noon  and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied thecurious cachinnation  but that neither scene nor season favoured fear i should have been superstitiously afraid  however  the event showedme i was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise
the door nearest me opened  and a servant came out   a woman ofbetween thirty and forty  a set  square made figure  red haired  andwith a hard  plain face  any apparition less romantic or lessghostly could scarcely be conceived
too much noise  grace   said mrs  fairfax   rememberdirections   grace curtseyed silently and went in
she is a person we have to sew and assist leah in herhousemaid s work   continued the widow   not altogetherunobjectionable in some points  but she does well enough  by thebye  how have you got on with your new pupil this morning
the conversation  thus turned on adele  continued till we reachedthe light and cheerful region below  adele came running to meet usin the hall  exclaiming
mesdames  vous etes servies   adding   j ai bien faim  moi
we found dinner ready  and waiting for us in mrs  fairfax s room
chapter xii
the promise of a smooth career  which my first calm introduction tothornfield hall seemed to pledge  was not belied on a longeracquaintance with the place and its inmates  mrs  fairfax turned outto be what she appeared  a placid tempered  kind natured woman  ofcompetent education and average intelligence  my pupil was a livelychild  who had been spoilt and indulged  and therefore was sometimeswayward  but as she was committed entirely to my care  and noinjudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans forher improvement  she soon forgot her little freaks  and becameobedient and teachable  she had no great talents  no marked traitsof character  no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raisedher one inch above the ordinary level of childhood  but neither hadshe any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it  she madereasonable progress  entertained for me a vivacious  though perhapsnot very profound  affection  and by her simplicity  gay prattle and efforts to please  inspired me  in return  with a degree ofattachment sufficient to make us both content in each other s society
this  par parenthese  will be thought cool language by personswho entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive forthem an idolatrous devotion  but i am not writing to flatterparental egotism  to echo cant  or prop up humbug  i am merely tellingthe truth  i felt a conscientious solicitude for adele s welfare andprogress  and a quiet liking for her little self  just as icherished towards mrs  fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness  anda pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she hadfor me  and the moderation of her mind and character
anybody may blame me who likes  when i add further  that  now andthen  when i took a walk by myself in the grounds  when i went down tothe gates and looked through them along the road  or when  while adeleplayed with her nurse  and mrs  fairfax made jellies in the storeroom i climbed the three staircases  raised the trap door of the attic  andhaving reached the leads  looked out afar over sequestered field andhill  and along dim sky line  that then i longed for a power of visionwhich might overpass that limit  which might reach the busy world towns  regions full of life i had heard of but never seen  that then idesired more of practical experience than i possessed  more ofintercourse with my kind  of acquaintance with variety of character than was here within my reach  i valued what was good in mrs  fairfax and what was good in adele  but i believed in the existence of otherand more vivid kinds of goodness  and what i believed in i wished tobehold
who blames me  many  no doubt  and i shall be calleddiscontented  i could not help it  the restlessness was in mynature  it agitated me to pain sometimes  then my sole relief was towalk along the corridor of the third storey  backwards and forwards safe in the silence and solitude of the spot  and allow my mind seye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it  and certainly  they were many and glowing  to let my heart be heaved bythe exultant movement  which  while it swelled it in trouble  expandedit with life  and  best of all  to open my inward ear to a tale thatwas never ended  a tale my imagination created  and narratedcontinuously  quickened with all of incident  life  fire  feeling that i desired and had not in my actual existence
it is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied withtranquillity  they must have action  and they will make it if theycannot find it  millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine and millions are in silent revolt against their lot  nobody knowshow many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the massesof life which people earth  women are supposed to be very calmgenerally  but women feel just as men feel  they need exercise fortheir faculties  and a field for their efforts  as much as theirbrothers do  they suffer from too rigid a restraint  too absolute astagnation  precisely as men would suffer  and it is narrow mindedin their more privileged fellow creatures to say that they ought toconfine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings  toplaying on the piano and embroidering bags  it is thoughtless tocondemn them  or laugh at them  if they seek to do more or learnmore than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex
when thus alone  i not unfrequently heard grace poole s laugh the same peal  the same low  slow ha  ha  which  when first heard  hadthrilled me  i heard  too  her eccentric murmurs  stranger than herlaugh  there were days when she was quite silent  but there wereothers when i could not account for the sounds she made  sometimes isaw her  she would come out of her room with a basin  or a plate  or atray in her hand  go down to the kitchen and shortly return  generally(oh  romantic reader  forgive me for telling the plain truth ) bearinga pot of porter  her appearance always acted as a damper to thecuriosity raised by her oral oddities  hard featured and staid  shehad no point to which interest could attach  i made some attempts todraw her into conversation  but she seemed a person of few words  amonosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort
the other members of the household  viz   john and his wife  leahthe housemaid  and sophie the french nurse  were decent people  but inno respect remarkable  with sophie i used to talk french  andsometimes i asked her questions about her native country  but shewas not of a descriptive or narrative turn  and generally gave suchvapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check thanencourage inquiry
october  november  december passed away  one afternoon injanuary  mrs  fairfax had begged a holiday for adele  because shehad a cold  and  as adele seconded the request with an ardour thatreminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in myown childhood  i accorded it  deeming that i did well in showingpliability on the point  it was a fine  calm day  though very cold i was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole longmorning  mrs  fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting tobe posted  so i put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry itto hay  the distance  two miles  would be a pleasant winterafternoon walk  having seen adele comfortably seated in her littlechair by mrs  fairfax s parlour fireside  and given her her best waxdoll (which i usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) toplay with  and a story book for a change of amusement  and havingreplied to her  revenez bientot  ma bonne amie  ma chere mdlle jeannette   with a kiss i set out
the ground was hard  the air was still  my road was lonely  iwalked fast till i got warm  and then i walked slowly to enjoy andanalyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour andsituation  it was three o clock  the church bell tolled as i passedunder the belfry  the charm of the hour lay in its approachingdimness  in the low gliding and pale beaming sun  i was a mile fromthornfield  in a lane noted for wild roses in summer  for nuts andblackberries in autumn  and even now possessing a few coraltreasures in hips and haws  but whose best winter delight lay in itsutter solitude and leafless repose  if a breath of air stirred  itmade no sound here  for there was not a holly  not an evergreen torustle  and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still asthe white  worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path  farand wide  on each side  there were only fields  where no cattle nowbrowsed  and the little brown birds  which stirred occasionally in thehedge  looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop
this lane inclined up hill all the way to hay  having reached themiddle  i sat down on a stile which led thence into a field  gatheringmy mantle about me  and sheltering my hands in my muff  i did not feelthe cold  though it froze keenly  as was attested by a sheet of icecovering the causeway  where a little brooklet  now congealed  hadoverflowed after a rapid thaw some days since  from my seat i couldlook down on thornfield  the grey and battlemented hall was theprincipal object in the vale below me  its woods and dark rookery roseagainst the  west  i lingered till the sun went down amongst thetrees  and sank crimson and clear behind them  i then turned eastward
on the hill top above me sat the rising moon  pale yet as acloud  but brightening momentarily  she looked over hay  which  halflost in trees  sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys  it wasyet a mile distant  but in the absolute hush i could hear plainlyits thin murmurs of life  my ear  too  felt the flow of currents  inwhat dales and depths i could not tell  but there were many hillsbeyond hay  and doubtless many becks threading their passes  thatevening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams  thesough of the most remote
a rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings  at onceso far away and so clear  a positive tramp  tramp  a metallic clatter which effaced the soft wave wanderings  as  in a picture  the solidmass of a crag  or the rough boles of a great oak  drawn in dark andstrong on the foreground  efface the aerial distance of azure hill sunny horizon  and blended clouds where tint melts into tint
the din was on the causeway  a horse was coming  the windings ofthe lane yet hid it  but it approached  i was just leaving thestile  yet  as the path was narrow  i sat still to let it go by  inthose days i was young  and all sorts of fancies bright and darktenanted my mind  the memories of nursery stories were there amongstother rubbish  and when they recurred  maturing youth added to thema vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give  as this horseapproached  and as i watched for it to appear through the dusk  iremembered certain of bessie s tales  wherein figured anorth of england spirit called a  gytrash   which  in the form ofhorse  mule  or large dog  haunted solitary ways  and sometimes cameupon belated travellers  as this horse was now coming upon me
it was very near  but not yet in sight  when  in addition to thetramp  tramp  i heard a rush under the hedge  and close down by thehazel stems glided a great dog  whose black and white colour madehim a distinct object against the trees  it was exactly one form ofbessie s gytrash  a lion like creature with long hair and a huge head it passed me  however  quietly enough  not staying to look up  withstrange pretercanine eyes  in my face  as i half expected it would the horse followed   a tall steed  and on its back a rider  the man the human being  broke the spell at once  nothing ever rode thegytrash  it was always alone  and goblins  to my notions  thoughthey might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts  could scarce covetshelter in the commonplace human form  no gytrash was this   only atraveller taking the short cut to millcote  he passed  and i wenton  a few steps  and i turned  a sliding sound and an exclamation of what the deuce is to do now   and a clattering tumble  arrested myattention  man and horse were down  they had slipped on the sheet ofice which glazed the causeway  the dog came bounding back  andseeing his master in a predicament  and hearing the horse groan barked till the evening hills echoed the sound  which was deep inproportion to his magnitude  he snuffed round the prostrate group  andthen he ran up to me  it was all he could do   there was no other helpat hand to summon  i obeyed him  and walked down to the traveller by this time struggling himself free of his steed  his efforts were sovigorous  i thought he could not be much hurt  but i asked him thequestion
are you injured  sir
i think he was swearing  but am not certain  however  he waspronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to medirectly
can i do anything   i asked again
you must just stand on one side   he answered as he rose  first tohis knees  and then to his feet  i did  whereupon began a heaving stamping  clattering process  accompanied by a barking and bayingwhich removed me effectually some yards  distance  but i would notbe driven quite away till i saw the event  this was finally fortunate the horse was re established  and the dog was silenced with a  down pilot   the traveller now  stooping  felt his foot and leg  as iftrying whether they were sound  apparently something ailed them  forhe halted to the stile whence i had just risen  and sat down
i was in the mood for being useful  or at least officious  i think for i now drew near him again
if you are hurt  and want help  sir  i can fetch some one eitherfrom thornfield hall or from hay
thank you  i shall do  i have no broken bones   only a sprain  and again he stood up and tried his foot  but the result extorted aninvoluntary  ugh
something of daylight still lingered  and the moon was waxingbright  i could see him plainly  his figure was enveloped in ariding cloak  fur collared and steel clasped  its details were notapparent  but i traced the general points of middle height andconsiderable breadth of chest  he had a dark face  with stern featuresand a heavy brow  his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful andthwarted just now  he was past youth  but had not reachedmiddle age  perhaps he might be thirty five  i felt no fear of him and but little shyness  had he been a handsome  heroic looking younggentleman  i should not have dared to stand thus questioning himagainst his will  and offering my services unasked  i had hardlyever seen a handsome youth  never in my life spoken to one  i had atheoretical reverence and homage for beauty  elegance  gallantry fascination  but had i met those qualities incarnate in masculineshape  i should have known instinctively that they neither had norcould have sympathy with anything in me  and should have shunnedthem as one would fire  lightning  or anything else that is bright butantipathetic
if even this stranger had smiled and been good humoured to mewhen i addressed him  if he had put off my offer of assistance gailyand with thanks  i should have gone on my way and not felt anyvocation to renew inquiries  but the frown  the roughness of thetraveller  set me at my ease  i retained my station when he waved tome to go  and announced
i cannot think of leaving you  sir  at so late an hour  in thissolitary lane  till i see you are fit to mount your horse
he looked at me when i said this  he had hardly turned his eyesin my direction before
i should think you ought to be at home yourself   said he   if youhave a home in this neighbourhood  where do you come from
from just below  and i am not at all afraid of being out late whenit is moonlight  i will run over to hay for you with pleasure  ifyou wish it  indeed  i am going there to post a letter
you live just below  do you mean at that house with thebattlements   pointing to thornfield hall  on which the moon cast ahoary gleam  bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods  that by contrast with the western sky  now seemed one mass of shadow
yes  sir
whose house is it
mr  rochester s
do you know mr  rochester
no  i have never seen him
he is not resident  then
no
can you tell me where he is
i cannot
you are not a servant at the hall  of course  you are   hestopped  ran his eye over my dress  which  as usual  was quite simple a black merino cloak  a black beaver bonnet  neither of them half fineenough for a lady s maid  he seemed puzzled to decide what i was  ihelped him
i am the governess
ah  the governess   he repeated   deuce take me  if i had notforgotten  the governess   and again my raiment underwent scrutiny  intwo minutes he rose from the stile  his face expressed pain when hetried to move
i cannot commission you to fetch help   he said   but you may helpme a little yourself  if you will be so kind
yes  sir
you have not an umbrella that i can use as a stick
no
try to get hold of my horse s bridle and lead him to me  you arenot afraid
i should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone  but whentold to do it  i was disposed to obey  i put down my muff on thestile  and went up to the tall steed  i endeavoured to catch thebridle  but it was a spirited thing  and would not let me come nearits head  i made effort on effort  though in vain  meantime  i wasmortally afraid of its trampling forefeet  the traveller waited andwatched for some time  and at last he laughed
i see   he said   the mountain will never be brought to mahomet so all you can do is to aid mahomet to go to the mountain  i mustbeg of you to come here
i came   excuse me   he continued   necessity compels me to makeyou useful   he laid a heavy hand on my shoulder  and leaning on mewith some stress  limped to his horse  having once caught thebridle  he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle  grimacinggrimly as he made the effort  for it wrenched his sprain
now   said he  releasing his under lip from a hard bite   justhand me my whip  it lies there under the hedge
i sought it and found it
thank you  now make haste with the letter to hay  and return asfast as you can
a touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear and then bound away  the dog rushed in his traces  all three vanished
like heath that  in the wilderness
the wild wind whirls away
i took up my muff and walked on  the incident had occurred andwas gone for me  it was an incident of no moment  no romance  nointerest in a sense  yet it marked with change one single hour of amonotonous life  my help had been needed and claimed  i had givenit  i was pleased to have done something  trivial  transitory thoughthe deed was  it was yet an active thing  and i was weary of anexistence all passive  the new face  too  was like a new pictureintroduced to the gallery of memory  and it was dissimilar to allthe others hanging there  firstly  because it was masculine  and secondly  because it was dark  strong  and stern  i had it stillbefore me when i entered hay  and slipped the letter into thepost office  i saw it as i walked fast down hill all the way home when i came to the stile  i stopped a minute  looked round andlistened  with an idea that a horse s hoofs might ring on the causewayagain  and that a rider in a cloak  and a gytrash like newfoundlanddog  might be again apparent  i saw only the hedge and a pollardwillow before me  rising up still and straight to meet themoonbeams  i heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful amongthe trees round thornfield  a mile distant  and when i glanced down inthe direction of the murmur  my eye  traversing the hall front  caughta light kindling in a window  it reminded me that i was late  and ihurried on
i did not like re entering thornfield  to pass its threshold was toreturn to stagnation  to cross the silent hall  to ascend the darksomestaircase  to seek my own lonely little room  and then to meettranquil mrs  fairfax  and spend the long winter evening with her  andher only  was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by mywalk   to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of anuniform and too still existence  of an existence whose very privilegesof security and ease i was becoming incapable of appreciating  whatgood it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in thestorms of an uncertain struggling life  and to have been taught byrough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which i nowrepined  yes  just as much good as it would do a man tired ofsitting still in a  too easy chair  to take a long walk  and just asnatural was the wish to stir  under my circumstances  as it would beunder his
i lingered at the gates  i lingered on the lawn  i pacedbackwards and forwards on the pavement  the shutters of the glass doorwere closed  i could not see into the interior  and both my eyes andspirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house  from the grey hollow filledwith rayless cells  as it appeared to me  to that sky expandedbefore me   a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud  the moonascending it in solemn march  her orb seeming to look up as she leftthe hill tops  from behind which she had come  far and farther belowher  and aspired to the zenith  midnight dark in its fathomlessdepth and measureless distance  and for those trembling stars thatfollowed her course  they made my heart tremble  my veins glow wheni viewed them  little things recall us to earth  the clock struck inthe hall  that sufficed  i turned from moon and stars  opened aside door  and went in
the hall was not dark  nor yet was it lit  only by the high hungbronze lamp  a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of theoak staircase  this ruddy shine issued from the great dining room whose two leaved door stood open  and showed a genial fire in thegrate  glancing on marble hearth and brass fire irons  and revealingpurple draperies and polished furniture  in the most pleasantradiance  it revealed  too  a group near the mantelpiece  i hadscarcely caught it  and scarcely become aware of a cheerful minglingof voices  amongst which i seemed to distinguish the tones of adele when the door closed
i hastened to mrs  fairfax s room  there was a fire there too but no candle  and no mrs  fairfax  instead  all alone  sittingupright on the rug  and gazing with gravity at the blaze  i beheld agreat black and white long haired dog  just like the gytrash of thelane  it was so like it that i went forward and said   pilot   and thething got up and came to me and snuffed me  i caressed him  and hewagged his great tail  but he looked an eerie creature to be alonewith  and i could not tell whence he had come  i rang the bell  fori wanted a candle  and i wanted  too  to get an account of thisvisitant  leah entered
what dog is this
he came with master
with whom
with master  mr  rochester  he is just arrived
indeed  and is mrs  fairfax with him
yes  and miss adele  they are in the dining room  and john is gonefor a surgeon  for master has had an accident  his horse fell andhis ankle is sprained
did the horse fall in hay lane
yes  coming down hill  it slipped on some ice
ah  bring me a candle  will you  leah
leah brought it  she entered  followed by mrs  fairfax  whorepeated the news  adding that mr  carter the surgeon was come  andwas now with mr  rochester  then she hurried out to give ordersabout tea  and i went upstairs to take off my things
chapter xiii
mr  rochester  it seems  by the surgeon s orders  went to bed earlythat night  nor did he rise soon next morning  when he did comedown  it was to attend to business  his agent and some of histenants were arrived  and waiting to speak with him
adele and i had now to vacate the library  it would be in dailyrequisition as a reception room for callers  a fire was lit in anapartment upstairs  and there i carried our books  and arranged it forthe future schoolroom  i discerned in the course of the morning thatthornfield hall was a changed place  no longer silent as a church it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door  or a clang ofthe bell  steps  too  often traversed the hall  and new voices spokein different keys below  a rill from the outer world was flowingthrough it  it had a master  for my part  i liked it better
adele was not easy to teach that day  she could not apply  she keptrunning to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she couldget a glimpse of mr  rochester  then she coined pretexts to godownstairs  in order  as i shrewdly suspected  to visit the library where i knew she was not wanted  then  when i got a little angry and made her sit still  she continued to talk incessantly of her  ami monsieur edouard fairfax de rochester   as she dubbed him (i had notbefore heard his prenomens)  and to conjecture what presents he hadbrought her  for it appears he had intimated the night before  thatwhen his luggage came from millcote  there would be found amongst it alittle box in whose contents she had an interest
et cela doit signifier   said she   qu il y aura la dedans uncadeau pour moi  et peut etre pour vous aussi  mademoiselle monsieur a parle de vous  il m a demande le nom de ma gouvernante et si elle n etait pas une petite personne  assez mince et un peupale  j ai dit qu oui  car c est vrai  n est ce pas  mademoiselle
i and my pupil dined as usual in mrs  fairfax s parlour  theafternoon was wild and snowy  and we passed it in the schoolroom  atdark i allowed adele to put away books and work  and to rundownstairs  for  from the comparative silence below  and from thecessation of appeals to the door bell  i conjectured that mr rochester was now at liberty  left alone  i walked to the window but nothing was to be seen thence  twilight and snowflakes togetherthickened the air  and hid the very shrubs on the lawn  i let down thecurtain and went back to the fireside
in the clear embers i was tracing a view  not unlike a picture iremembered to have seen of the castle of heidelberg  on the rhine when mrs  fairfax came in  breaking up by her entrance the fierymosaic i had been piecing together  and scattering too some heavyunwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude
mr  rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take teawith him in the drawing room this evening   said she   he has beenso much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before
when is his tea time   i inquired
oh  at six o clock  he keeps early hours in the country  you hadbetter change your frock now  i will go with you and fasten it  hereis a candle
is it necessary to change my frock
yes  you had better  i always dress for the evening when mr rochester is here
this additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately  however  irepaired to my room  and  with mrs  fairfax s aid  replaced my blackstuff dress by one of black silk  the best and the only additional onei had  except one of light grey  which  in my lowood notions of thetoilette  i thought too fine to be worn  except on first rateoccasions
you want a brooch   said mrs  fairfax  i had a single little pearlornament which miss temple gave me as a parting keepsake  i put it on and then we went downstairs  unused as i was to strangers  it wasrather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in mr  rochester spresence  i let mrs  fairfax precede me into the dining room  and keptin her shade as we crossed that apartment  and  passing the arch whose curtain was now dropped  entered the elegant recess beyond
two wax candles stood lighted on the table  and two on themantelpiece  basking in the light and heat of a superb fire  laypilot  adele knelt near him  half reclined on a couch appeared mr rochester  his foot supported by the cushion  he was looking atadele and the dog  the fire shone full on his face  i knew mytraveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows  his square forehead  madesquarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair  i recognised hisdecisive nose  more remarkable for character than beauty  his fullnostrils  denoting  i thought  choler  his grim mouth  chin  andjaw  yes  all three were very grim  and no mistake  his shape  nowdivested of cloak  i perceived harmonised in squareness with hisphysiognomy  i suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense ofthe term  broad chested and thin flanked  though neither tall norgraceful
mr  rochester must have been aware of the entrance of mrs fairfax and myself  but it appeared he was not in the mood to noticeus  for he never lifted his head as we approached
here is miss eyre  sir   said mrs  fairfax  in her quiet way  hebowed  still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child
let miss eyre be seated   said he  and there was something inthe forced stiff bow  in the impatient yet formal tone  which seemedfurther to express   what the deuce is it to me whether miss eyre bethere or not  at this moment i am not disposed to accost her
i sat down quite disembarrassed  a reception of finished politenesswould probably have confused me  i could not have returned or repaidit by answering grace and elegance on my part  but harsh capricelaid me under no obligation  on the contrary  a decent quiescence under the freak of manner  gave me the advantage  besides  theeccentricity of the proceeding was piquant  i felt interested to seehow he would go on
he went on as a statue would  that is  he neither spoke normoved  mrs  fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some oneshould be amiable  and she began to talk  kindly  as usual  and  asusual  rather trite  she condoled with him on the pressure of businesshe had had all day  on the annoyance it must have been to him withthat painful sprain  then she commended his patience andperseverance in going through with it
madam  i should like some tea   was the sole rejoinder she got she hastened to ring the bell  and when the tray came  she proceededto arrange the cups  spoons  etc   with assiduous celerity  i andadele went to the table  but the master did not leave his couch
will you hand mr  rochester s cup   said mrs  fairfax to me  adele might perhaps spill it
i did as requested  as he took the cup from my hand  adele thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour cried out
n est ce pas  monsieur  qu il y a un cadeau pour mademoiselle eyredans votre petit coffre
who talks of cadeaux   said he gruffly   did you expect a present miss eyre  are you fond of presents   and he searched my face witheyes that i saw were dark  irate  and piercing
i hardly know  sir  i have little experience of them  they aregenerally thought pleasant things
generally thought  but what do you think
i should be obliged to take time  sir  before i could give youan answer worthy of your acceptance  a present has many faces to it has it not  and one should consider all  before pronouncing an opinionas to its nature
miss eyre  you are not so unsophisticated as adele  she demandsa "cadeau " clamorously  the moment she sees me  you beat about thebush
because i have less confidence in my deserts than adele has  shecan prefer the claim of old acquaintance  and the right too of custom for she says you have always been in the habit of giving herplaythings  but if i had to make out a case i should be puzzled  sincei am a stranger  and have done nothing to entitle me to anacknowledgment
oh  don t fall back on over modesty  i have examined adele  andfind you have taken great pains with her  she is not bright  she hasno talents  yet in a short time she has made much improvement
sir  you have now given me my "cadeau"  i am obliged to you  it isthe meed teachers most covet praise of their pupils  progress
humph   said mr  rochester  and he took his tea in silence
come to the fire   said the master  when the tray was takenaway  and mrs  fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting while adele was leading me by the hand round the room  showing methe beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres we obeyed  as in duty bound  adele wanted to take a seat on my knee but she was ordered to amuse herself with pilot
you have been resident in my house three months
yes  sir
and you came from
ah  a charitable concern  how long were you there
eight years
eight years  you must be tenacious of life  i thought half thetime in such a place would have done up any constitution  no wonderyou have rather the look of another world  i marvelled where you hadgot that sort of face  when you came on me in hay lane last night  ithought unaccountably of fairy tales  and had half a mind to demandwhether you had bewitched my horse  i am not sure yet  who are yourparents
i have none
nor ever had  i suppose  do you remember them
no
i thought not  and so you were waiting for your people when yousat on that stile
for whom  sir
for the men in green  it was a proper moonlight evening forthem  did i break through one of your rings  that you spread thatdamned ice on the causeway
i shook my head   the men in green all forsook england a hundredyears ago   said i  speaking as seriously as he had done   and noteven in hay lane  or the fields about it  could you find a trace ofthem  i don t think either summer or harvest  or winter moon  willever shine on their revels more
mrs  fairfax had dropped her knitting  and  with raised eyebrows seemed wondering what sort of talk this was
well   resumed mr  rochester   if you disown parents  you musthave some sort of kinsfolk  uncles and aunts
no  none that i ever saw
and your home
i have none
where do your brothers and sisters live
i have no brothers or sisters
who recommended you to come here
i advertised  and mrs  fairfax answered my advertisement
yes   said the good lady  who now knew what ground we were upon  and i am daily thankful for the choice providence led me to make miss eyre has been an invaluable companion to me  and a kind andcareful teacher to adele
don t trouble yourself to give her a character   returned mr rochester   eulogiums will not bias me  i shall judge for myself she began by felling my horse
sir   said mrs  fairfax
i have to thank her for this sprain
the widow looked bewildered
miss eyre  have you ever lived in a town
no  sir
have you seen much society
none but the pupils and teachers of lowood  and now the inmates ofthornfield
have you read much
only such books as came in my way  and they have not been numerousor very learned
you have lived the life of a nun  no doubt you are well drilled inreligious forms   brocklehurst  who i understand directs lowood  isa parson  is he not
yes  sir
and you girls probably worshipped him  as a convent full ofreligieuses would worship their director
oh  no
you are very cool  no  what  a novice not worship her priest  thatsounds blasphemous
i disliked mr  brocklehurst  and i was not alone in the feeling he is a harsh man  at once pompous and meddling  he cut off ourhair  and for economy s sake bought us bad needles and thread  withwhich we could hardly sew
that was very false economy   remarked mrs  fairfax  who now againcaught the drift of the dialogue
and was that the head and front of his offending   demanded mr rochester
he starved us when he had the sole superintendence of theprovision department  before the committee was appointed  and he boredus with long lectures once a week  and with evening readings frombooks of his own inditing  about sudden deaths and judgments  whichmade us afraid to go to bed
what age were you when you went to lowood
about ten
and you stayed there eight years  you are now  then  eighteen
i assented
arithmetic  you see  is useful  without its aid  i should hardlyhave been able to guess your age  it is a point difficult to fix wherethe features and countenance are so much at variance as in yourcase  and now what did you learn at lowood  can you play
a little
of course  that is the established answer  go into the library i mean  if you please   (excuse my tone of command  i am used tosay  "do this " and it is done  i cannot alter my customary habits forone new inmate )  go  then  into the library  take a candle withyou  leave the door open  sit down to the piano  and play a tune
i departed  obeying his directions
enough   he called out in a few minutes   you play a little  isee  like any other english school girl  perhaps rather better thansome  but not well
i closed the piano and returned  mr  rochester continued
adele showed me some sketches this morning  which she said wereyours  i don t know whether they were entirely of your doing  probablya master aided you
no  indeed   i interjected
ah  that pricks pride  well  fetch me your portfolio  if you canvouch for its contents being original  but don t pass your word unlessyou are certain  i can recognise patchwork
then i will say nothing  and you shall judge for yourself  sir
i brought the portfolio from the library
approach the table   said he  and i wheeled it to his couch  adeleand mrs  fairfax drew near to see the pictures
no crowding   said mr  rochester   take the drawings from myhand as i finish with them  but don t push your faces up to mine
he deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting  three he laidaside  the others  when he had examined them  he swept from him
take them off to the other table  mrs  fairfax   said he   andlook at them with adele   you  (glancing at me)  resume your seat  andanswer my questions  i perceive those pictures were done by onehand  was that hand yours
yes
and when did you find time to do them  they have taken muchtime  and some thought
i did them in the last two vacations i spent at lowood  when i hadno other occupation
where did you get your copies
out of my head
that head i see now on your shoulders
yes  sir
has it other furniture of the same kind within
i should think it may have  i should hope  better
he spread the pictures before him  and again surveyed themalternately
while he is so occupied  i will tell you  reader  what they are and first  i must premise that they are nothing wonderful  thesubjects had  indeed  risen vividly on my mind  as i saw them with thespiritual eye  before i attempted to embody them  they werestriking  but my hand would not second my fancy  and in each case ithad wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing i had conceived
these pictures were in water colours  the first representedclouds low and livid  rolling over a swollen sea  all the distance wasin eclipse  so  too  was the foreground  or rather  the nearestbillows  for there was no land  one gleam of light lifted intorelief a half submerged mast  on which sat a cormorant  dark andlarge  with wings flecked with foam  its beak held a gold bracelet setwith gems  that i had touched with as brilliant tints as my palettecould yield  and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart sinking below the bird and mast  a drowned corpse glanced throughthe green water  a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible whence the bracelet had been washed or torn
the second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak ofa hill  with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze beyond and above spread an expanse of sky  dark blue as at twilight rising into the sky was a woman s shape to the bust  portrayed intints as dusk and soft as i could combine  the dim forehead wascrowned with a star  the lineaments below were seen as through thesuffusion of vapour  the eyes shone dark and wild  the hair streamedshadowy  like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail on the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight  the same faintlustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed thisvision of the evening star
the third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar wintersky  a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances  closeserried  along the horizon  throwing these into distance  rose  in theforeground  a head   a colossal head  inclined towards the iceberg and resting against it  two thin hands  joined under the forehead  andsupporting it  drew up before the lower features a sable veil  abrow quite bloodless  white as bone  and an eye hollow and fixed blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair  alone werevisible  above the temples  amidst wreathed turban folds of blackdrapery  vague in its character and consistency as cloud  gleamed aring of white flame  gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge this pale crescent was  the likeness of a kingly crown   what itdiademed was  the shape which shape had none
were you happy when you painted these pictures   asked mr rochester presently
i was absorbed  sir  yes  and i was happy  to paint them  inshort  was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures i have ever known
that is not saying much  your pleasures  by your own account  havebeen few  but i daresay you did exist in a kind of artist sdreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints  did yousit at them long each day
i had nothing else to do  because it was the vacation  and i satat them from morning till noon  and from noon till night  the lengthof the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply
and you felt self satisfied with the result of your ardentlabours
far from it  i was tormented by the contrast between my idea andmy handiwork  in each case i had imagined something which i wasquite powerless to realise
not quite  you have secured the shadow of your thought  but nomore  probably  you had not enough of the artist s skill and scienceto give it full being  yet the drawings are  for a school girl peculiar  as to the thoughts  they are elfish  these eyes in theevening star you must have seen in a dream  how could you make themlook so clear  and yet not at all brilliant  for the planet abovequells their rays  and what meaning is that in their solemn depth  andwho taught you to paint wind  there is a high gale in that sky  and onthis hill top  where did you see latmos  for that is latmos  there put the drawings away
i had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio  when  looking athis watch  he said abruptly
it is nine o clock  what are you about  miss eyre  to let adelesit up so long  take her to bed
adele went to kiss him before quitting the room  he endured thecaress  but scarcely seemed to relish it more than pilot would havedone  nor so much
i wish you all good night  now   said he  making a movement of thehand towards the door  in token that he was tired of our company and wished to dismiss us  mrs  fairfax folded up her knitting  itook my portfolio  we curtseyed to him  received a frigid bow inreturn  and so withdrew
you said mr  rochester was not strikingly peculiar  mrs  fairfax  i observed  when i rejoined her in her room  after putting adele tobed
well  is he
i think so  he is very changeful and abrupt
true  no doubt he may appear so to a stranger  but i am soaccustomed to his manner  i never think of it  and then  if he haspeculiarities of temper  allowance should be made
why
partly because it is his nature  and we can none of us help ournature  and partly because he has painful thoughts  no doubt  toharass him  and make his spirits unequal
what about
family troubles  for one thing
but he has no family
not now  but he has had  or  at least  relatives  he lost hiselder brother a few years since
his elder brother
yes  the present mr  rochester has not been very long inpossession of the property  only about nine years
nine years is a tolerable time  was he so very fond of his brotheras to be still inconsolable for his loss
why  no  perhaps not  i believe there were somemisunderstandings between them  mr  rowland rochester was not quitejust to mr  edward  and perhaps he prejudiced his father againsthim  the old gentleman was fond of money  and anxious to keep thefamily estate together  he did not like to diminish the property bydivision  and yet he was anxious that mr  edward should have wealth too  to keep up the consequence of the name  and  soon after he was ofage  some steps were taken that were not quite fair  and made agreat deal of mischief  old mr  rochester and mr  rowland combinedto bring mr  edward into what he considered a painful position  forthe sake of making his fortune  what the precise nature of thatposition was i never clearly knew  but his spirit could not brook whathe had to suffer in it  he is not very forgiving  he broke with hisfamily  and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life  idon t think he has ever been resident at thornfield for a fortnighttogether  since the death of his brother without a will left himmaster of the estate  and  indeed  no wonder he shuns the old place
why should he shun it
perhaps he thinks it gloomy
the answer was evasive  i should have liked something clearer but mrs  fairfax either could not  or would not  give me more explicitinformation of the origin and nature of mr  rochester s trials  sheaverred they were a mystery to herself  and that what she knew waschiefly from conjecture  it was evident  indeed  that she wished me todrop the subject  which i did accordingly
